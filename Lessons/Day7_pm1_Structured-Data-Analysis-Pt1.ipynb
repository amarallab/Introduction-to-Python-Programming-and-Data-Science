      "Pandas is a contraction for \"panel data\", which is kind of an obtuse saying. A shorthand way of thinking about it is to think of it as dealing with a connected series of data, like a company's stock price over time. Particularly, most spreadsheets fall into this category so pandas is the most natural way of working with Excel-type data using Python. \n",

      "But first let's confront the ugly reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Pandas is not very pythonic\n",
      "\n",
      "Actually **using** Pandas and not just using it to read files can be conceptually difficult and is a bit of a mental switch compared to most of what we have learned so far. If you want to iterate over things, you can't use a `for` loop easily. Instead you'll need to use specific Pandas methods to do whatever functions you want. These little differences add up and can wear on you, which might make you want to stop using Pandas. That's a fine way to feel (you don't really *have* to use it), but there are some big benefits to using it, that for a lot of people, are worth the costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Benefits of Pandas\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Pandas handles a lot of file I/O drudgery for you. I'll show you this in a bit, but reading CSV files and accessing data in them is super simple\n",
      "2. Pandas has a lot of *magic* built into, automaticallly taking care of many type conversions after reading a file\n",
      "3. Using Pandas **is** like working with [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) (don't know what SQL is? Don't worry, it's a bit advanced for this course but is surely something you'll encounter if you continue to program so it's worth reading up on). So learning Pandas means that you'll have a good idea of the underpinnings how SQL databases work which might help you later in your programming education (although the syntax is different).\n",
