Subject: What is a Developmental Disability?



  Dear Governor Bush,
I had written to you once before involving Florida's Medicaid Waiver. Again 
I am writing to you as I feel that this is a major problem for many families 
throughout Florida who have children with disabilities such as myself. As 
the bill is currently written, Medicaid Waiver only assists the 5 most vocal 
elite.  There are many other populations which have great need as well. In 
many other states throughout the U.S. Michigan and Ohio to name but a few, 
have already written a bill which protects all children irregardless of 
their disability. The premise behind their definition of what a 
Developmental Disability is, is that all children irregardless of their 
affliction are behind where they should be developmentally. Therefore they 
are developmentally delayed. For example a child who wears braces may take 
longer to get from point A to point B than his/her "normal" peers without a 
disability. A deaf child will learn to speak slower than his/her  hearing 
peer.
Not only has the insurance companies consistently discriminated against 
neurological disorders and other populations not included on the Waiver 
plan, but as the Waiver is presently written, families with children of 
disibilites are being discriminated once again by the State itself. If the 
bill was to be rewitten, it would serve to benefit all "isms"  and not just 
a select few. My son, Keith has Muscular Dystrophy. He wears braces and 
receives physical therapy as well as occupational and physical therapy. Blue 
Cross-Blue Shield refused to pay $1600 for my son's braces and over $3000 in 
therapy for 2 months of services, I could not turn to the waiver to help me 
out. Without the waiver my son is further excluded from a PCA/ respite care, 
transportation services which would allow my son a lift to and from Therapy 
so that I could continue to work in the capacity I was hired. I ended up 
losing my job as I used my lunch time to transport my son to and from and it 
usually took too long to return on time. Actually for me it was a blessing 
as I immediately applied for medicaid and the medical bills were paid, as 
were my son's braces. What about all of the other parents who can't afford 
to lose their jobs. It is unfair that we as parents of the underserved 
population struggle to be good parents and make ends meet and in the end it 
is a choice that has to be made. That choice being, to work, or get your 
child services. Why can't we work and be productive citizens and still get 
our children the services that thet need. Please help us to help our 
children. It is a matter of dignity as well as necessity.  I speak on behalf 
of all families of the underserved population, we need your help. This is a 
service that should be open to all special needs populations.
I thank you for your time and understanding im this matter.

I've only talked with him on the phone but the Governor has spent time with
him at the First event last year, and Governor has seen the First program
first hand -- no pun intended.  Dean is considered one of the more
innovative persons in America today, but I can't vouch for his politics.
He just wants POTUS to mention First in the speech, since the speech is
supposedly about education, and First has new hampshire ties.  I think the
Governor can speak more to Dean personally and his program.

Dear Ms. Bonvissuto:

Thank you for your August 25th email to Governor Bush regarding services
for your son, Justin.  The Governor asked me to reply on his behalf.

Let me begin by saying that I understand there has been a lot of
misinformation being circulated around the state and I would like to take
this opportunity to clarify some that which was evident in your e-mail.

You said in your e-mail that "one family in Miami filed a lawsuit and took
away all available funding."  The Developmental Disabilities Program within
the Department of Children and Families has been sued.    One of the
lawsuits was filed on behalf of a child in the Miami/ Ft. Lauderdale area
claiming that waiver services were not being provided equitably to all
individuals currently enrolled on the Developmental Services Home and
Community-Based Services waiver (the waiver).  This lawsuit became a "class
action lawsuit," which basically means that many other individuals
throughout the state fall under similar circumstances.  Therefore, the
Department had to show the court how it would make waiver services equally
available to all individuals who were currently enrolled on the waiver
throughout the state of Florida.

The one family whose name appeared on the lawsuit did NOT take away all
available funding.  Additionally, the Department has made every effort to
provide services that are medically necessary to all individuals currently
enrolled on the waiver.

Your e-mail also stated that since your son can "walk, talk, dress himself,
etc., he is at the bottom of the list for funding."  That too, is a
misconception.  Eligibility for waiver services is NOT based on individual
abilities.  An individual is eligible for waiver services when he/she:
1)   Is a consumer of the Developmental Disabilities Program;
2)   The individual's IQ is 59 or under;
3)   The individual's IQ is 60-69 and has a secondary handicapping
condition that includes cerebral palsy, spina bifida, Prader-Willi
syndrome, epilepsy, autism, ambulation, sensory, chronic health, and
behavior; OR, the individual's IQ is 60-69 and he/she has severe functional
limitations in at least three of the major life activities, including
self-care, learning, mobility, self-direction, understanding and use of
language, and capacity for independent living;
4)   The individual is eligible under a primary disability of autism,
cerebral palsy, spina bifida, or Prader-Willi syndrome.  In addition, the
condition must result in severe functional limitations in three or more
major life activities, including self-care, learning, mobility,
self-direction, understanding and use of language, and capacity for
independent living;
5)   The individual or the legal guardian must choose to receive home and
community-based supports and services.

All individuals applying for waiver services since July 1, 1999; who have
also been determined eligible based on the criteria mentioned above, have
been placed on a waiting list (with the exception of individuals considered
to be in a life-threatening crisis as identified on Florida's Crisis
Identification Tool).  When Governor Bush came into office in January of
1999, he became aware of the extensive waiting list for waiver services.
That waiting list consisted of thousands of individuals who for years were
told that they could not receive waiver services due to lack of funds.  The
Governor vowed to eliminate this waiting list by requesting additional
funding from the Florida Legislature during the 1999 Legislative Session.
Before releasing the funds, the Legislature asked the Department of
Children and Families, Developmental Disabilities Program Office for a
Spending Plan that would be acceptable to them.

That Spending Plan clearly identifies ways of eliminating the waiting list
in existence prior to July 1, 1999.  In order to eliminate that waiting
list, a new one had to be created for individuals who have become clients
of the Department since July 1, 1999.   Based on the Spending Plan and the
fact that your son applied for services after July 1, 1999 (our records
indicate he applied for services in September 2000) he is now on the new
waiting list.

The Governor continues to show his support to our program and we anticipate
to begin enrolling on the waiver individuals who applied for services since
July 1, 1999, on or about March of 2002.  We will begin to enroll
individuals in the order in which they became clients of Developmental
Disabilities.

While we are unable to enroll your son on the waiver right away, we hope to
serve him and meet those needs that are medically necessary and available
through the waiver pending availability of vacancies and funding this
spring.  The local Developmental Disabilities Program will stay in touch
with you and let you know when funds become available to enroll Justin.

In your e-mail you also stated that "people released from jail, who are
married, are automatically given funding."  That statement is not accurate
and I hope that the information I have provided above clarifies how an
individual is eligible for and receives waiver services.  Anytime you hear
information like the one you stated in your e-mail, you may call your local
Developmental Disabilities Program to seek clarification.

I do understand that your son meets the eligibility criteria for waiver
services and look forward to being able to serve him in the future.

Dear Mr. Yablonski,

Thank you for getting back to me so quickly today.  As we discussed, I was
very excited to learn that part of the President's agenda during his
upcoming trip to New Hampshire is to talk about his education plan.  I
appreciate your willingness to work with Governor Bush to emphasize the
importance of FIRST to the President.  

I am grateful that Governor Bush has been a great supporter of FIRST.  He
has both visited and spoken at our national championship at Disney's EPCOT
Center for the last few years and I understand he plans to do so again this
year.  

I know the New Hampshire audience would respond very well to comments the
President might offer regarding FIRST.  As you know, FIRST has become a
major, national partnership between business and the educational community.
However, FIRST is particularly relevant to a New Hampshire audience because
- 

*	FIRST was founded and has it's national headquarters in Manchester,
New Hampshire.
*	The University of New Hampshire, where the President will be making
his remarks, supports FIRST teams and is in the process of preparing a
national survey on the impact of FIRST.
*	There is great emotional commitment to FIRST's ideals within the New
Hampshire community.
*	Senators Gregg and Smith, and Congressmen Bass and Sununu, have been
long-term supporters of this homegrown, non-profit organization.
*	President Bush is aware of the program.  In fact, during an event at
my home he committed to recognize our winning students and their corporate
sponsors in a White House ceremony.
*	Both former Presidents Bush and Clinton have welcomed FIRST's
winning teams to the White House and this was received very well throughout
New Hampshire.

This year's FIRST competition will include nearly 700 corporate sponsors,
each with their own adopted schools from 44 different states.  There will be
17 cities across the United States, including New York, Los Angeles,
Chicago, Orlando and Houston, holding regional competitions.  Tens of
thousands of students who might never have otherwise seen science and
technology as exciting or accessible opportunities will participate in these
events, and millions will watch these events on television.

As you might guess, I will travel to the President's address on the 8th by
Segway HT to demonstrate that technology and education lead to exciting
possibilities.  When I spoke with Andy Card earlier today (I also asked him
to stress the importance of FIRST to the President) I offered the
opportunity for both he and the President to ride the Segway HT.  I would
also welcome the opportunity to demonstrate the Segway HT to you and the
Governor at your convenience.

Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today and I hope to see you
soon.

Respectfully,

Subject: Florida approved book vendor list; 1% surchage issue



Dear Governor: 

Thank you for returning Harold Fitzgerald's telephone call so promptly.  It was a pleasure to speak with you and briefly acquaint you with two issues that are vitally important to Gumdrop Books.  

Issue One:  Being placed on the Florida approved book vendor list.  

Due to the fact that Florida changed its method of bid notifications from a packet to a postcard, several book vendors, including Gumdrop, did not receive the postcard inviting us to bid for a place on the approved vendor list.  When we realized that the normal deadline to apply was close, we contacted the Florida Department of Education and were told that the deadline had passed.  They said they were sorry that we had not received the postcard but that we would be able to apply in the autumn to get on the list along with other vendors who also did not received the postcard.  This we did in early September but we were told that a decision would not be made until early December.  With follow-up calls, we found that Genny Boynton with the State Purchasing Department (tel: 850-488-7996) was handling our application.  However, she had been out of the office for several weeks and our application sat on her desk.  

Last week we finally spoke with Ms. Boynton only to learn that she had misplaced our bid.  We immediately faxed her a copy and followed up with her the next day by which time she had found the original bid.  When we asked what the next step should be, she informed us that after our bid left her desk in about two weeks, it would go to someone else for approval.  This could take four to six weeks before we could be on the list.

We explained the urgency in getting on the list as we are unable to sell books to our Florida librarian customers who are growing impatient while waiting.  Naturally, impatience will become lost sales unless we can get this resolved immediately.  Ms. Boynton called our office on Monday, Dec. 10th to let us know that Gumdrop Books was not registered in Florida, which we immediately rectified.

Waiting another six weeks to get on the list will substantially add to the loss of business we have already incurred in your state.

Issue Two:  1% vendor surcharge fee on contractors' sales.  

This year the Florida Department of Management Services added this surcharge which must be paid 15 days after the end of each contract quarter.  Failure to comply with this new requirement will result in the supplier being removed from the state contract.  To the best of our knowledge, Florida is the only state that requires a quarterly payment in order to do business within its borders.  This surcharge will not help generate sales and in fact will increase our prices when the funds allocated to purchase our books are, in fact, normally state funds.

Again, thank you for your willingness to hear our concerns on both of these issues.  We are hopeful that with your assistance, some resolution to these issues may be found in a very timely fashion.

Our toll free number is 1-800-821-7199.  Vice President Jeff Fitzgerald's personal email is jeff@gumdropbooks.com.  He is looking forward to hearing from you.  Thank you again for taking time to consider these issues..

I'm not sure of your question, Governor.   Does passing the fcat test provide for a diploma for homeschoolers?   If so, that is exactly what I was asking, and I just wasn't aware.  If not, can that test be used to grant a diploma equivalent to a regular high school diploma without the need for students to attend GED classes?  That would seem to be the perfect solution. 

Thank you for your consideration.

Official: GPW closure not trouble-free 

7 jailed, 3 dead, 1 missing, official confirms 


The state's plan to shift G. Pierce Wood patients into community-based 
programs has gone very well, according to Celeste Putnam, director of 
mental health programs for the Florida Department of Children and 
Families. 

However, that doesn't mean the transition from the DeSoto County mental 
hospital has been trouble-free, she confirmed this week. 

Putnam, in a phone interview, responded to confirm that, of 215 patients 
discharged since January, seven have been jailed, three died and one was 
missing. 

Also, three of 22 Florida Assertive Community Treatment teams, which 
were 
launched in the past two years to provide supervision for discharged 
patients in their home communities, have run amok with problems. 

One of those teams, the Ruth Cooper Center's team in Fort Myers, 
disbanded 
and dropped its state contract. Putnam said DCF is working to hire 
another 
team "with a proven track record" to take over the Fort Myers clients. 

Another team, the Bolley Center's team in St. Petersburg, was barred for 
weeks from taking on new patients. But problems have since been 
corrected 
and the moratorium lifted. 

Another team also came under scrutiny elsewhere in the state until 
problems 
were corrected, Putnam said. 

But, she pointed out, the 22 teams now have 862 patients statewide, an 
average of 39 each. The teams will eventually supervise 100 each, or 
2,200 
patients statewide. 

"We're working with them very closely," Putnam said. "Overall, given 
that 
we have 22 teams, we think they are doing very well. 

"In fact, the Legislature in the last session asked us to start up three 
more FACT teams in the non-GPW areas," Putnam noted. 

Some 38 percent of GPW's discharged patients are now living 
independently 
under the supervision of the FACT teams, according to a report of a Nov. 
27 
GPW staff meeting. 

Only 6 percent -- 13 out of 215 -- were discharged to nursing homes, 
according to another DCF report. 

"Clients in independent living are maintaining," the GPW staff report 
said. 
"Most are taking (their) meds and keeping appointments." 

The closure plan calls for a GPW discharge outreach team to take a 
patient 
to the new community residence -- where a FACT team member was supposed 
to 
be waiting to meet the new client. 

Putnam confirmed reports, however, that on "a couple of occasions very 
early on in our discharge process" there was no FACT team member present 
to 
receive the patient. That problem was corrected, however, she said. 

"There were no serious incidents that resulted (from the failure to meet 
the patient)," Putnam said. 

Putnam confirmed, however, that a number of nursing homes and assisted 
living facilities turned away mental patients because they were too 
difficult to supervise. 

"The ALFs just could not meet their needs," Putnam said. 

However, she said, the candor of the ALFs allowed GPW staffers to find 
more 
suitable arrangements for the patients elsewhere. 

Since July, some 27 patients have been discharged to other state 
hospitals 
because they were too ill to be shifted into community programs. 

Since January, only two discharged GPW patients were involuntarily 
committed back into a state hospital, under the Baker Act. 

"We've reduced hospitalizations -- compared to 1999 -- by 77 percent," 
she 
said. 

At least nine patients left the state, and three left the country. 

Putnam said seven discharged patients wound up in jail. However, five 
have 
since been released, she said. 

None of the incarcerations were for "serious incidents, that I'm aware 
of," 
Putnam said. 

Three discharged patients have died. Putnam said she knows of no death 
due 
to neglect. The causes included heart attack, stroke and "progressive 
decline in a nursing home," Putnam said. 

The patient who apparently died of a heart attack, John Hicks, 56, stirs 
further questions, however. He died in the loft of his group home in 
East 
Fort Myers, according to a Lee County Sheriff's report. One of the 
paramedics who responded called an abuse hotline after noting the room 
was 
unsanitary. 

Putnam also said one patient disappeared from a Manatee County FACT team 
and hasn't been seen since. He left his apartment to visit his parents 
for 
Thanksgiving and never arrived. Police have been notified. 

"We are concerned about the fact he's missing but I don't think it's 
because of the FACT team," Putnam said. 

As of early December, the hospital had just 88 patients remaining. Of 
those, 38 were to be discharged into community programs and 50 to other 
state hospitals. 

There were 450 employees, with about 240 who have yet to line up new 
jobs, 
according to GPW newsletter.

Governor:
Have reviewed in detail the latest e-mail you received from Gov. Barnes.
I think either the Governor has not been given the whole picture by his
staff, or Georgia is really
interested in simply extending the talks, while their real focus is on the
ongoing federal litigation (which they have argued successfully to keep
Florida out).

In summary:
#1
Gov. Barnes is incorrect to say that Florida is now asking for more water
than what was proposed in the May draft proposal.  In some periods it is
more, in some it is less ---but the net effect of the changes that have
occured since May is likely less water for Florida.

Basically if the next 50 years look pretty much like the last 50 in terms of
precipitation, then we are basically in agreement with Georgia over water
allocation.  Georgia's concern is that the next 50 years may as a whole be
less wet.  We have provided an "insurance policy" for them by creating a
substitute water allocation schedule if there simply is not enough water in
the tri-river system to meet everyone's needs.  This "insurance policy" --
in the event the future precipitation is less than historic -- works to
benefit Georgia.

#2
His argument that the federal govt. agriculture irrigation experts have no
better "guess" than his own scientists on an appropriate "drought year
multiplier" is simply wrong.  I am concerned the Governor is being given bad
information.  The federal scientists are not guessing...they base their
projections on actual historical data over a long period of record.
Georgia's technical team knows their proposed drought year multiplier of 2.2
(120% more irrigation water than in a normal year) is completely
indefensible. (It would be more like aquaculture than agriculture!)  They
have never offered a defense of their extraordinary proposal on this point.

#3
The argument that Florida always benefits when Georgia holds more water back
in its reservoirs is silly.  The whole point of an equitable water
allocation is shared abundance and shared adversity.  Reservoirs can (and
should) be used to manage some of the "peaks and valleys" (abundance and
adversity) -- but not completely insulate upstream interests from these
natural cycles, while placing the full brunt on the downstream interests.

#4
The issue raised about waiting for new data is spurious.  In December of
2001 (with two weeks left to negotiate), it suddenly becomes imperative to
review soon to be published data from 1994-2000?  The raw data has been
readily available to all interests.  Now they want to wait for it to be
published?  The data shows nothing unexpected; we have simulated it in our
model.

#5
Legal drafting issues are not a great delay.  Perhaps a week's work at most
-- nothing that would require a year's extension.

#6
I can't comment on Governor Barnes' argument to wait to "take the politics
out" of this issue since I don't know Georgia politics.  From our view here
in Florida, this is about the least political thing we are working on.  It
is driven by the scientists and engineers.

#7
The argument that somehow Florida is going to have to pay the federal
government because Georgia wants the reservoirs in Georgia to be
re-programmed from hydropower production to water supply is most unusual.
In any event, federal law governs these issues, and it is an issue apart
from the water allocation issue that falls under this Compact.

#8
Finally, it is troubling to see that Governor Barnes' staff has apparently
advised him that we have reached an agreement on the Lake Lanier issues,
apart from everything else.  Clearly, we are seeking a comprehensive,
basin-wide agreement.  We are pleased that Georgia likes the results they
are getting for Lake Lanier water elevations (I think this is their highest
priority), but the benefit of the bargain goes both ways.  Georgia must
agree to all of the other elements of the allocation formula as well -- not
just the parts that they feel benefit them.


I am not sure another round of e-mails between you and Governor Barnes will
accomplish much at this point.  I suggest we get our technical experts
together again next week and see if we can't further narrow the issues
before you have to spend more time on this.  We will then brief you on just
the remaining key differences.

I am taking a short trip to help support the Florida tourism industry this
weekend.  If you need any more information on this please call Teri
Donaldson, DEP's General Counsel.  Look forward to seeing you in the new
year.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I wish to send you wishes for a "peaceful" and "joyful" New Year.
 
With all that has happened this past year, especially since the "attacks" in September in New York, Pennsylvania, and especially in Washington D.C., I know that the State of Florida has felt the consequences, in many of the departments and agencies, as the affects of the economy "trickle" down to this "vacation" state.
 
I am sure that you and your staff have experienced a lot of confusion in trying to keep the lives of the residents of Florida as safe and prosperous as you can, and there are many of us who include you - and your brother, the President - in our daily prayers.
 
I ask in return, only that you and your staff remember the communities of people with disabilities in Florida, who are even more affected by this devastation and change, by all the "cuts" in the programs, which give their lives "just a little taste" of what we all receive, and sometimes that we "take for granted".
 
May God Be With You, and continue to "Bless You", in all that you do in your day-to-day decision making for this coming year, 2002.

Dear Governor Bush,

I hope you had a great Christmas this year!  You'll be
happy to know that I ended up with a 3.4GPA this
semester even though I was a percentage point away
from A's in 3 classes! lol (one of them was
Renaissance History)  I did have a question about your
internship program.  I would like to apply for the
Florida Washington-based office for Summer 2002.  When
exactly is the deadline for this?  I would ideally
love to be in D.C. for the summer but I also will
apply for the Tallahassee based positions as well.  Do
you have any internship programs for your re-election
campaign as well?

In other news, I'm looking forward to hearing your
father speak at UF this January.  If I get the
opportunity, I would love to ask him if he remembers
getting cookies from some very young entrepreneurs in
St. Paul, Minnesota when he was Vice-President.  Those
were my cousins actually.

Hope you have a great New Year's!

Sincerely,
Shannon Liston

Dear Silvia & #1 Mother Elsa:
First of all Happy New Year. Let there be Peace on Earth!
Monroys - 4 legals and an economist/psychologist!
Do you have Juan's e-mail address?  How about Marco Jr.?  Would Silvia be 
interested in working on a juvenile law project in Florida? I have been 
meeting quite a few of the judges in Broward and Palm Beach County when I go 
to juvenile government seminars. I guess Silvia is going to be the only 
non-legal in your family, Elsa. When I was in London, I believe Silvia told 
me she was going to take a course in Japan or China culture. You and Judge 
Marco must be so  proud of her accomplishments. LWEI could use Silvia on on 
this program we hope to implement with the Juvenile Court System throughout 
Florida eventually. Isabel Afanador's  relatives just went back to Colombia 
so we are going to discuss the Juvenile Court Project now! I met Isabel thru 
the Youth Fish Fdn Projects of Dr. Sam Porco's as I am on his board and also 
his Community Relations Director. Dr. Porco, DDS, resides and has his dental 
practice in Homestead. Dr. Sam and his wife, Pat, are out to make a 
difference in the lives of foster kids or troubled ones. Dr. Sam has worked 
with kids for 14 years now using his dental practice money when he can't 
raise stocking the ponds with fish and feed from the private sector. 
Governor Bush has been trying to be supportive of these programs as well as 
the Dept of Juvenile Justice Directors/Judges. MIAMI/DADE for Florida.  They 
have heard all about the Monroys and their accomplishments from me and are 
anxious to meet you.As you probably recall, Elsa, I met your son Marco Jr. in 
the Rotonda Jacuzzi when he was attending Georgetown Law School and Juan was 
a teenager with the big smile and laughing brown eyes in the Rotonda pool 
with us every nite. Then along came Silvia, Marco Sr.'s baby girl - what 
wonderful parents you and Judge Marco Monroy Sr. have been. I remember when 
Juan's best friend was shot in Bigota - how is the family doing? I wrote a 
poem to the Remes family at that time.  Silvia was living with me then as you 
were back in Bigota. Silvia and I couldn't believe a youth's life could be 
snuffed out so quickly over keys to a car that the killer wanted. He was 
probably on drugs.Such a tragedy to happen to that nice young man. I met him 
when he visited Juan at the Rotonda. As a mother myself, I felt the pain for 
the family. Isbabel would like to meet you when you come to visit me here in 
FL, VA or DC.  I hope that Isabel and her son can go to the Cherry Blossom 
Festivities this year - it is always the lst week in April. I belong to the 
Florida State Society. Did you know that Florida is the only state society 
that has its own Embassy on-the-hill? Right near the metro, too! Get Marco 
Jr., Esq. to take you there next time you are in DC. Is he still in 
international environmental law? LWEI is 12 years old now and 2 of those 
years have been spent researching kids programs needed for low income kids in 
FL.  Can you help me to establish a program for juvenile kids with Probation 
Courts and Judges? Are you still a presiding  judge in family court there in 
Bigota. I have been attending meetings at county courthouses and conferences. 
We want to make a difference with these at risk kids.  Will enlighten you 
more if you or the family are interested in this endeavor.This would be kids 
on probation and giving small seminars on diversity, drugs, similar to the 
work I did in DC in educ & training at those international seminars. Silvia 
went to a couple of them.  Jenny Lu was my international intern at National 
Assn of Women Business Owners NAWBO(Jenny will graduate from Medical School 
in March - wants to intern in emergency room) Eventually I believe she will 
wind up in primary care in South America as she is such a caring person and 
now speaks fluent Spanish.  I went to her brother's wedding, Tom Lu, another 
doctor who graduated cum laude from Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. Please get 
back to me by e-mail as soon as you can so I can put a team together. God 
bless and God bless America....  Fondly,  Lynne


hispanic speaking creative young enthusiastic communicators like you and your 
international lawyer family.  Let's make a difference to these kids in 
trouble - love never fails, teach it by giving it. I put that on the Elks 
Brick in memory of my niece, Nancy Warrick Hillmire, who was a teacher of the 
year in special education in Seneca Falls, NY before she died in 1999 
suddenly at age 50 as you will recall. St Mary's had one of the largest 
attended funerals in the small town.   but all kids in trouble, especially 
the lower income groups. I do need some team players that can speak Spanish 
fluently. Silvia, are you available?  Much is going on in Florida.  Pompano 
Beach might get the construction contract from the National Olympics Board of 
Directors out in Colorado.  Wow, they would have their practice Olympic Pool 
within walking distance of my condo at Pompano Beach.  This would be the 
training spot for soccer, badminton, tennis and of course the Swimming Hall 
of Fame thus an Olympic pool will be built. I will go to the Pompano Beach 
Commissioners Bd of Directors meeting 8 January 2002.

Happy New Year!!!! God bless and God bless America.  Love, Lynne

Still drinking that Colombian Coffee......  Many thanks for keeping me well 
supplied with the java over the years.....  Lynne

>Voters Will Grade Gov. Bush On Hasty Education Reforms
>
>Published: Dec 30, 2001
>
>G ov. Jeb Bush's education reforms are going to be a primary target for his
>critics during the upcoming political year.
>The governor has been faulted for adopting many of his A-Plus reforms
>without allowing public debate. Teachers, in particular, have felt left 
>out.
>
>There is no question the impatient Bush likes to move fast, which results 
>in
>some high-handed directives that are resented by the people who must 
>execute
>them. His rapid and radical overhaul of the higher education system was
>particularly troubling.
>
>But Bush also promised before his election to change the way Florida 
>schools
>operate and no one can accuse him of not keeping his word.
>
>His zeal for quick change has unquestionably caused problems. The governor
>rightly sought to hold schools accountable for their students' performance.
>But his and Lt. Gov. Frank Brogan's plan initially graded schools solely on
>test results - ignoring the different challenges schools face. A school
>attended mostly by students from stable, middle-class homes may score
>impressively on the state's standardized tests, while a school attended
>mostly by poor children may score much lower. Yet the teachers of
>disadvantaged children - who may receive little academic guidance at home -
>may well be working harder and better.
>
>The flaw in the testing system was revealed by the Palm Beach Post in an
>analysis of test scores and family income at more than 2,000 public
>elementary and middle schools. It found that schools with the wealthiest
>students consistently received the highest scores.
>
>But to his credit, Bush has been willing to address such shortcomings.
>
>The other day the governor and the Florida Cabinet revised the testing
>program, putting more emphasis on an individual student's progress in
>reading, writing and math.
>
>Schools will be graded for improving students' performance, rather than
>simple test results.
>
>``This will mark the very first time that we've been able to track
>individual children from one year to the next and report on their
>progress,'' said Gerry Richardson, the Florida DOE's evaluation and
>reporting director.
>
>
>Tracking Progress
>
>The Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test originally given in grades 4, 5, 
>8
>and 10, will now be given to all grades from 3 to 10. The progress of each
>student will be tracked.
>
>The revised system will award schools points based on three measures: the
>latest student test scores, a comparison with those children's scores from
>the previous year, and the annual gain of the school's worst readers.
>Reading, so critical to a child's academic success, will account for half
>the grade.
>
>The changes should make the test a far more accurate measure of the child's
>academic progress and the school's effectiveness.
>
>All this won't quiet Bush's critics. The governor can be faulted for
>throwing the education furniture into the air. The question for voters next
>year will be whether this upheaval has resulted in better schools or chaos.

December 29, 2001

To: Friends of Live the Life Ministries

From: Richard Albertson

1) Please continue praying for one of our Board members, Thierry Kobes, his wife Diane, and their 3 children.  Here is the latest update on his situation (Thanks to Suetta Clawson for the information):

Thierry's latest MRI shows his brain tumor to be a little larger and even a small change in its size can make a "big" difference.  It could mean two things...either the tumor has grown or there is more dead matter (meaning that the chemo has been working).  Thierry and Diane will be heading to Houston, TX for surgery on January 9th.  Thierry has stated his desire to go through with it.  His other option was to call Hospice... Of course, there are many risks connected with surgery--possible further damage to his speech, Thierry could be paralyzed and in a vegetative state, or he might not make it through the surgery.  He has had all the radiation his body can handle so that option is out.  

Right now Thierry is having a lot of difficulty speaking, still having seizures, cannot concentrate for very long, tires easily, is sleeping a lot, and is experiencing occasional disorientation.  His response to all of this is vintage Thierry:  ""Everyone's worried--there's no need to worry.  God is in control and on His Throne and I have a peace about all this.  It's all going to be okay."  What faith and assurance!  When we've exhausted all we can do, then it leaves no doubt about God's intervention and His divine, healing power. -- It just makes the miracle that much more spectacular! 

For those of you who have expressed a desire to do something for the Kobes Family--such as a meal, child care, etc. pleased contact Rebecca Eppinger at 893-8652.


2) Are you a "Hands-On" Parent?  Parents who are "hands-on" have a much better chance of keeping their kids drug-free.  That's what a new study by the National Center of Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) found.  CASA says "hands-on" parents do the following:  
 Monitor their kids TV-watching and internet use
 Put restrictions on which CDs their kids buy
 Know where their kids are after school and on weekends
 Give regular chores to their children
 Are "very aware" of their teen's grades
 Have a curfew
 Eat dinner together most every night - with no TV
 Have an adult present when their child gets home from school
 Are told the truth about their teenager's whereabouts
 Let their kids know they won't tolerate any drug use

The CASA survey found that teenagers with "hands-off" parents are at double the risk for smoking, drinking and using drugs.

Governor, I wanted to give you a brief heads up on a machine you are going
to hear about in the next couple of weeks.  For a couple of months, I have
been working with a firm in Miami that distributes a body scanner that is
applicable for airports, government offices, prisons, and so on for body
scanning of materials that a person has on or in them.  We have had several
conversations with the FAA, Secret Service, and so on at the federal level.
Kathleen and I discussed this a couple of months ago and she guided me to
Tim Moore who then got us together with Scotty Sanderson and Bill Butler at
FDLE.  They have been very receptive and are willing to see the machine
tested up here at the Knott Building, but obviously need approval and
guidance from you, the Senate, and the House.  I am forwarding below a
description from my colleague Jim Rimes of the process so far, and how this
was going to be in the Orlando Airport, but that is now on hold and he
explains why.  This is quite timely becuause this machine would have
detected the plastic explosives in the shoes of the terrorist last week and
is very appropriate for the kind of security concerns it appears we will
have in this country for quite some time.  I would love to see Florida be on
the cutting edge of this issue and so I wanted you to be fully aware of what
will be proposed soon.  The company's web sites are below as well as some
links to articles about the machine that could be helpful.  I appreciate
your attention to this and hope you are having a great time in Boca Grande.
Take care. Randy

Dear Governor Bush,
     This has been a troubling year (2001) and so many of us have been impacted by events since September 11.  Your leadership (and that of your brother) have held us together as a state and as a nation.  
     I wanted to say thank you, and to ask that you keep persons with disabilities close to your heart in the coming year.  So many are likely to go without the services and supports they need (those on waiting lists) and there is great anxiety growing in our special community.  You have demonstrated your compassion and support for us in the past, and I have faith you will continue to do so, using your influence with the legislature to do the right thing as they make budget cuts.
     Warmest wishes go out to you and your family from the Sherman family.  May you have a wonderful 2002.

Pat and Jan,
 
Someone once told me, Craig If you want to keep something, you must be prepared to give it away.  I want to keep the pressure on my BoD and other home owner's issues. Tom is doing a great job for me individually. In fact the BoD implemented several issues at the last BoD meeting. I promise, when we win, I will publish everything.
 
Now what about CHORE and CCFJ uniting for the common good.  For an example, CHORE could have a Florida Chapter and CCFJ could have a Arizona Chapter.  
 
One immediate benefit would be all dispatches would go to both sets of politicians.  AZ and Fl are very similar, except for salt water.  Both have old folks retiring, HOA's, CAI, Sun, vacation spots and other common interests.  
 
Maybe we could get the politicians to indulge in some competition to see who can pass laws faster for their states.  At the very least, we could inform both sets of politicians to each other's problems.  Maybe we could get a govenor to promiss a box of sun shine to each other.  sunshine as in open legal HOA laws.
 
Just a thought.  
 
Craig.

A brief update:

I spoke with Kevin Tang in your legal department.  He apparently spoke with someone
in the DOT about the no parking signs because I was contacted by a field rep.
However, nothing was ever done, I am still the only business on the entire length of
Orange Avenue in Ft. Pierce which the public cannot park in front of and the local
county commission, specifically one Mr. Bruhn is still doing everything in his power
t shut my business down.

To date, this has cost me in excess of $20,000.00.  I am almost bankrupt.  Our
county government at work.

I know this is trivial in the larger scheme of things but I felt compelled to bring
you up to date.

Thank you,

Dear Jeb,

First let me wish you and yours a wonderful peacefilled New Year's and may 2002 bring you all that you are hoping to accomplish. I am here to assist you in this venture in any way that I can. I will work with Mike Hamer and Linda Cooper as best as I can on your campaign. I have tried with my all my might to get you to implement the $3,950,000.00  dollars potentially allocated by BTI for your digital divide and other programs but no one has gotten this ball rolling and BTI has all but ruled the offer dead! It has been over a year and a half closer to two! and Frank Brogan was down in south Florida for a Broward Days event just to tell you how long it's been!

It is our patriotic duty to try and protect our fellow Americans from the terrorists that committed the hideous crimes of 9-11-01. That is why President Bush signed into law on October 26th., 2001 Public Law 107-56 Terrorism Bill. We owe it to ourselves, and our country, to comply with this law.

It requires us to give our law enforcement agencies records of accounts, emails, and data files on activities that have happened within our web sites, should terrorists use your web site for information or promotion of terrorists activities. Without the proper tracking mechanisms and log files embedded in your web site or server, there would be no way for you to turn over this information.

Remember the 19 hijackers of 911 used our Internet web sites to find where to be trained, where to live, and where to buy crop dusters. They also stole peoples identities from job banks and job opportunity centers on-line. They stayed undetected for 18 months with the help of information gained from our web sites!

Showing our nation that your web site is in compliance with the Patriotic Act of 2001 is your patriotic duty and should not be set aside. We are making it easy for you.

1.Request a compliance analysis of your web site. The price for this service is dependent on the size of your web site. Not to be compliant is too high of a price for any of us to pay! Terrorists chose little companies first, so dont think you are too small to comply! 

2. Once the analysis has been performed, you will receive a detailed report of any areas of your web site that are not in compliance. You will also receive suggestions/solutions for compliance.

3.Either have your IT staff make the changes or hire an outside firm to fix your compliance issues. Accurateinfo.com can do this for you, but we are not the only ones.

You are now letting all people who come to your site know that you are supporting our country and our President by complying with the Patriotic Act of 2001.

I am sending you this message that I have on my web site about HR3162 compliance. This is known as the terrorism bill. Please take a moment and make sure your web site is in compliance. Also do your patriotic duty and pass this information to any company which you know is not in compliance. Our entire country is depending on us (the IT community) to help them stay protected.
This is not a one man show, and I am not in any way saying or even implying that I have the only answer. I don't!!

Most people do not understand this law and furthermore, do not know what to do to comply with it. It is not well written and was put together in haste, but I feel our Congress and Senate did so in our best interest. 
It is up to us to help make this work. It will put a noose around the current al qaida's necks, since  they are  here, and we don't know where they are! Having our web sites monitor if any suspicious activities occur might tip our government off to where they are, and where they are going to hit again?

Jeb  I see in the St. Pete Times that you will be pursuing some initative on the school funding as it relates to development approvals.  I think one of the most fundamental problems is the disconnect between the school need issue (driven by development to ssome extent but not exclusively) and the funding that is controlled at the state level.  Recently because of some litigation on a DRI we have reviewed extensively the process by which money is translated into new space and student stations at the state and local level.  Even to the extent that you obtain a contribution process from development there is no mechanism by which those dollars will improve school overcrowding on any immediate basis.   As a result housing costs continue to rise without achieving  a meaningful benefit.   To achieve any meaningful result you must look at the funding mechanism for both capital facilities and operations at the state and local level.  WIthout that all the development exactions in the world will not alter the outcome.  I was shocked to find in my analysis of the issue how little understanding exists on this subject..   My research showed that there is no rule or policy published by DOE which defines the basis upon which new schools are determined to be  built.  It seems as if it operates on some nebulous basis like incipient policy.   The school boards and DOE don't want to bring on new facilities as underutilized infrastucture and operating costs so the system is designed to have some degree of overcrowding to maxiimize efficiency.  I hope that you will include some further research on this point in any legislative proposals.   If I am off the mark I would be delighted to be educated.  I agree there is a problem that needs fixing but you have to look at the delivery side of the system at the same time you look at the cost side. Happy Holidays.

Everglades Restoration Plan to Be Unveiled 
 _____Special Report_____ 

* Army Corps of Engineers: Documents, graphics and recent coverage. 
 
 
By Michael Grunwald
Washington Post Staff Writer
Friday, December 28, 2001; 12:58 PM 


The Bush administration is unveiling the long-awaited rules governing the
$7.8 billion restoration of the Florida Everglades this afternoon, and
environmentalists are already warning that the rules could imperil the
largest ecological effort in history.

A 58-page draft of the rules obtained by The Washington Post includes few of
the specifics and assurances that conservation groups had said were
necessary to make sure the project actually restores the parched South
Florida ecosystem. For example, Congress had requested interim performance
goals to help measure the project's progress over the next three decades,
but the rules only include a proposed process for setting goal-- no
timeline.

Instead, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the federal agency overseeing
this massive replumbing job, limited its "programmatic regulations" to
generalities, maintaining maximum flexibility for its own officials to run
the project according to unspecified "protocols." Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's
administration--backed by sugar farmers and urban water utilities who fear
that their water will be diverted to the Everglades at the expense of South
Florida's economy--had also complained that more detailed rules would
trample on the state's right to allocate water as it sees fit, and the Corps
cited those arguments in its documents.

"I'm sure plenty of groups are going to zero in on something they won't
like," said Stuart Applebaum, who is overseeing the restoration for the
Corps. "When you have something this extraordinarily complicated with this
many stakeholders, that's what you expect."

At first glance, though, it seemed like environmentalists were going to be a
lot unhappier than other stakeholders. Many of them do not trust the Corps,
which drained the Everglades at the behest of Congress in the 1950s,
ushering in an era of slow decline for the so-called River of Grass. Today,
half of the Everglades are gone, along with 90 percent of its storied wading
birds. The nationwide concern for "America's Everglades" inspired the
4,000-page restoration plan that Congress passed overwhelmingly during the
heat of the 2000 campaign.

However, that initial blueprint for 68 projects - eliminating canals,
storing water, building pumps - left much to be decided later, and
environmentalists were counting on these programmatic regulations to fill in
many of the blanks. For example, many conservationists believe that without
strict assurances that the Everglades will get the water it needs to recover
its health, the region's water will keep going to development and
agricultural interests instead. The regulations the Corps is releasing today
include no such guarantees - just another proposal for a process to help
"evaluate and identify water to be reserved for the natural system" under
state law.

"This just screams business as usual," said Shannon Estenoz, the World
Wildlife Fund's Everglades director. "They talk a lot about state's rights.
What about the rights of federal taxpayers to get what they're paying for:
Everglades restoration?"

Environmentalists had also hoped for assurances that scientists would be
insulated from the political process, and that the Department of
Interior--which runs Everglades National Park--would get an expanded and
well-defined role in the regulations. That didn't happen, either.

"Basically, this is a regulation to do everything outside the scope of the
regulations and congressional oversight," said Bradford Sewell, a senior
attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council. "It's codifying a broken
process in federal regulations."

Applebaum said the Corps will seek public comment, and intends to float its
final proposal next March.

The resolution is to be sent to Ms. Laura Mahoney, U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, PO. Box 4970, Jacksonville, Florida 32232-0019 not later than December 31, 2001. 

AGENDA ITEMS 

I. Loxahatchee River/Indian River Lagoon Feasibility Study--Debra Drum--Coastal Ecosystems and Patti Sime--SFWMD 

Patrick Hayes (Friends of the Loxahatchee and the Jonathan Dickinson State Park) and Lloyd Brumfield 
(Martin County Conservation Alliance) have registered complaints about the Loxahatchee River (Wild and 
Scenic River) running into the Jupiter Inlet through Martin County being totally ignored in the Southern Indian River Lagoon Feasibility and in the CERP plan as they understood. It appears that the south branch, Palm Beach County, is being very badly mistreated--ignored, too. 

Salt water intrusion is in the Martin County Loxahatchee up to Trapper Nelson's and cypress trees are dying from lack of fresh water. In the Palm Beach County fork of the Loxahatchee are huge developments being approved that will draw a lot of water from Canal 18 which will affect both the 'sick' branches of the Loxahatchee. 

Deborah Drum (SFWMD) reported that for the first time the Loxahatchee has received a small sum for some study. She said that a plan known as the NORTH PALM BEACH COUNTY PLAN has some restoration for the Loxahatchee, however, she indicated that restoration is yet to be fully defined. She said that she would get an electronic version of the North Palm Beach Plan for those who were on the EAC sign-in sheet. Lloyd Brumfield said he would pursue a printed copy, too.   Drum also said that the Loxahatchee Coordinating Council is studying the River. Hayes and Brumfield said they were not impressed with the Coordinating Council's results so far. 
[Post Facto response: To: Interested members of the Environmental Action Committee; Please find the following link to www.evergladesplan.org with some information regarding the North Palm Beach County plan as per your 
recent request. I am still working with SFWMD staff to get a copy of the draft plan to each of you electronically. In the meantime, this link may provide some useful background info on the project. Thanks for you patience. 
Sincerely, Deborah Drum 
Senior Supervising Planner, Coastal Ecosystems Division, SFWMD 
http://www.evergladesplan.org/the_plan/2lev_projects.shtml] 

Patrick Hayes said that the Florida Department of Environmental Protection appeared to be only interested in Minimum Flows and Levels which Hayes said he is under the impression the MFL would be about 200 feet per second which would cause significant harm. 

II. SCT (Science Coordinating Team) The Flow Paper--Nick Aumen--Everglades National Park---Mr. Aumen has worked on Lake Okeechobee, Loxahatchee and other water assignments in his 10 years in South Florida.  He is the SCT point of contact for smoothing a draft White Paper "The Role of Water and Sediment Flows in the Ridge and Slough Landscape," July 14, 2001.   Evidence in the White Paper suggest that in 1940 the Tamiami Trail (Miami-Dade, and Collier Counties) resulted in two artificial compartments, north and south, where once there has been continuous landscape and flow across same.   The central hypothesis is that water flow (sheet flow) and sediment transport, both unimpeded by man-made obstructions, must be present to maintain the Ridge and Slough landscape pattern originally presented.  It has been postulated by the SCT that Everglades restoration requires full elevation of the Tamiami Trail--Highway U.S. 41.   ]The CoE proposal is for a 5% solution (3000 feet in a stretch of some 10 - 11 Miles)].  The White Paper caused a great deal of criticism by the Corps of Engineers and the M-Tribe reps. The criticism was more about the process (not substance) of the White Paper being authorized, peer review and distribution through channels.  The Florida Game and Freshwater Fish Commission, many years ago noted the presence of the flocculent layer of loose organic matter and its detrimental effects on the Everglades in the Tamiami Trail dam effect.   Another draft of the White Paper is scheduled to be completed by December 14, 2001. This time the process will be pursued especially peer review.   (EAC Chair has requested an update.)    This is the first paper since the Conceptual Restudy, now CERP, Section 2.3, to fully document the need for flows in the Everglades. 
None of the Agencies involved has fully focused on the baseline as established in CERP Section 2.3 (Dynamic Storage & Sheet Flow), CERP Goals and Objectives (Section 5.5, Table 5-1 = The PROMISE, per the NEPA/WRDA process; See Attached) 

III. East Coast Issues---Rosa Durando 

The endangered Loxahatchee River and the Indian River Lagoon Feasibility have nothing to do with the Everglades restoration. Palm Beach County has been the victim of bad planning and political development permitting by the County Government, the SFWMD and the Corps. 

IV. West Coast Issues--Fran Stallings 

Two thirds of the development permitted in South Florida would not be allowed if the existing laws-rules-regulations were followed by local governments, SFWMD, the Florida Department of Environmental Regulations, the federal EPA, and the Army Corps. All of these agencies are scofflaws and rogues ignoring their own laws. 
In the Naples-Ft. Myers area five golf courses and several developments are full speed ahead with consumptive permits approved by all agencies. The aquifer is still low and will be put-upon even more during dry seasons when all of the new development comes on line.   Fran's assessment is that the only way the permitting agencies will do what is right is to take them into Federal court in a law suit; this seems to be the only thing respected. All of these agencies are dancing to the tune called by the development industry and the agriculture industry. The natural 
system is taking a real beating with official approval by the agencies. 

V. Members/Public Comments 

Mike Murphy---SFWMD---A retreat for strategic planning has been held that discussed the acquisition of property for the Everglades Restoration and the Indian River Lagoon Feasibility Study. The agencies, SFWMD, have the 
power of eminent domain but has decided to use the willing seller process. 

Steven Bell---Invasive Exotic Plant/Tree Issue is being ignored to a large degree. It will 2015 before any attention will be given to exotics and then the growth will have greatly expanded with the cost being tremendous to remove. 

John distributed to the EAC a memorandum (12/04/01) Public Comments to WRAC. The concerns of 
SW Florida citizens about unmitigated development on the Florida west coast and the loss of wetlands.  A second memorandum (11/31/01) was sent the to CROGEE  (Committee on Restoration of the Greater Everglades Ecosystem) to answer the question posed by CROGEE:  "How can help we help Everglades Restoration!" 

VI. Approval of Minutes of November EAC Meeting 

VII--Next Meeting--Wednesday, January 2, 2002- 10:30 AM--SFWMD Headquarters.   Lesley Blackner will give her "Protecting Wetlands" Presentation."    We have requested the B-1 Auditorium as the crowd is growing. 

Respectfully Submitted, 
John Arthur Marshall, 
Chair, EAC

Governor --

Per Frank, you should be going off of Sec. Struhs' draft (attached again to
avoid confusion).  However, Frank thinks it can be tightened so I'm doing
that.

If you have specific notes you'd like me to address as well, please let me

THE FOLLOWING ARE DRAFT REMARKS FOR THE GOVERNOR'S VIDEO-TAPED MESSAGE
TO
THE EVERGLADES COALITION MEETING.


Hello.  We have a tradition of reporting on progress and announcing new
developments at the annual Everglades Coalition meeting.  I didn't want
to
break that tradition, so I appreciate the opportunity to send this
message.

Let me begin by congratulating this year's conference co-chairs, Erin
Deady
and Frank Jackalone.  The agenda you organized highlights how far we
have
come these past few years, as well as the opportunities ahead.

I remember a year ago humbly receiving the honor of being designated a
"Steward of the Everglades."  Governors receive many recognitions --
some
more deserved than others.  But few have meant as much to me as that
honor.
That's because few things are more important to South Florida's
environment
and economy than restoring the Everglades.  And few things are more
important to me.

I also remember my first meeting with you, where it was duly noted (some
might say duly warned) that I was a conservative Republican born in the
Texas oil patch to an oil man father, and I then went on to become a
developer in Florida.  Well, all those things are still true -- as they
will
always be.

But we have some new truths we didn't have 3 years ago:  We have
launched
the largest environmental restoration project the world has ever known.
All
of our critical land acquisitions are on schedule.  Environmental
results
are exceeding expectations in the Kissimmee River headwaters.  The
first-ever pollution limits have been established for Lake Okeechobee.
And
six Stormwater Treatment Areas have been constructed on budget and on
schedule and are performing 50-percent better than expected.

And on that oil issue -- just for the record -- we have prevented new
drilling leases in the Everglades and off of Florida's coast.  Never
before
has Florida's coastline been so protected.

I think we have also established new levels of access and confidence
between
my office and yours.  This is going to help us as we work through some
important issues in the months ahead.  Three things come to mind:

First, how do we make sure that the water entering the Everglades gets
cleaned up?  The science has confirmed what many of you have long
suspected:
phosphorous levels in the Everglades must be brought down to 10 parts
per
billion.

I was pleased to personally appear before the Environmental Regulatory
Commission to make that recommendation.  It was an important step that I
will never forget!  But I also know full well that there is a big
difference
between setting a standard and achieving it.

We all know that it will take decades before such an exacting standard
can
be met across more than 2 million acres.  However, there will be no
backsliding; only forward progress with timely and measurable results.

Our challenge is to simultaneously ensure the retreat of cattails in the
Everglades Protection Area, while staving off the march of the red tile
roofs of development into the Everglades Agricultural Area.  This will
best
be accomplished with new investments in water quality, while limiting
new
and expensive opportunities for delay by lawyers and lobbyists.

The Second thing I want to mention is the agreement I need to sign with
my
brother that promises Florida will reserve the water necessary for
natural
systems before federal money is released for construction projects.

We will do this to make sure that federal money keeps flowing and
projects
stay on schedule.  More importantly, we will do this because it is the
right
thing to do.

If anyone questions Florida's resolve to reserve water for healthy
ecosystems, I direct your attention North to the Apalachicola River.
There
we have been in difficult discussions with our neighboring states over
equitable water allocations. Florida has been willing to give up
substantial
amounts of water to avoid the uncertainties of litigation.  However, my
instructions have been clear: there is no compromise when it comes to
the
minimum flows necessary to maintain the functional integrity of that
River
and Bay environment.

The same holds true for the Everglades.  The difference is we don't have
to
negotiate with another government, and the legal tools for water
reservations are already in place.

Finally, there is the need to keep paying the bills for Everglades
restoration.  We are starting the New Year off right:  All of the bills
are
paid.  There is money in the savings account (trust fund).  And we have
a
perfect credit record.  All of this in war-time while revenues have
temporarily fallen far short of the mark.

Given that, I found it amusing to read in the paper a recent quote from
one
of your members that referred to "the Everglades Funding Problem."  Some
"problem!"  There are plenty of other programs in Florida government
today
that wish they enjoyed the same strong position as the Everglades.

I suspect the real concern being expressed was, "WIll Everglades funding
always be in such great shape?"

Here again, the news is good.  Consider the fact that key legislators
(Republicans and Democrats; North and South Florida) have already
indicated
their support to borrow money if ever needed to keep restoration on
track.
I agree that we should be prepared to borrow the money if necessary.

However, I would go a step further.  If the Everglades are the priority
we
say they are, then let's do everything we can first to make sure we
don't
run out of money.  Let's use sound money management to make sure we have
revenues for this project that are secure and reliable -- and debt free.

Making Everglades restoration more expensive by taking on un-budgeted
interest payments makes it less likely, not more likely, that the
project
will be completed on schedule.  This is particularly true if debt is
taken
on in these early stages that will come due when we are in our peak
spending
years in a decade.

In a few days I will for the third year in a row propose to fully fund
the
Everglades at 100-million-dollars.  What will be different this year are
the
sources of that revenue -- sources that are more reliable and more
secure
than ever before.  It is a 3-part plan.

First, it continues the proven, reliable commitment of dedicating
25-million-dollars a year from our Florida Forever Program for
Everglades
land acquisition.

Second, it provides a dedicated source of funds by capturing the growth
in
document-stamp revenues in the state's subsidized housing program.
Because
of growing revenues, the housing program can remain fully-funded at
current
levels while providing increasing amounts for Everglades restoration.
Beginning with 13-million-dollars a year in the early years, this
dedicated
revenue source will grow to as much as 25-million-dollars by 2010.

Third, we will provide a secure source of funding by better managing
existing Florida Forever debt and by tapping excess document-stamp
revenue
before it rolls over into General Revenue accounts.

Currently, as a condition of bonding, susbstantial document-stamp
revenue is
held "in reserve" to help guarantee our Florida Forever debt.  We can
free
this money up for the Everglades today by insuring our debt rather than
keeping cash in reserve.  Using surety bonds to meet our reserve
requirements on existing debt is a more cost-effective strategy for
securing
additional resources than simply taking on additional new debt.

This, when combined with a commitment to direct a portion of the
predictable
growth in document-stamp revenue
 directly into the Everglades Trust Fund before it is placed into a
General
Revenue account, will make $50 to $60 million of reliable, debt-free
dollars
available every year for the Everglades for the rest of this decade.

Total it all up, and we have our first Billion dollar commitment for the
Everglades from the State of Florida!

I applaud the broad political commitment in Florida to fund this
project.
And I respect the need for contingencies -- including borrowing should
that
ever become necessary.  It is an option we will never give up.  But with
the
support of the Legislature and the Cabinet, we will first exercise every
option to make sure that reliable, secure, debt-free dollars are
available
as needed to pay for our highest environmental priority.

We have come a long way together these past few years.  This year is no
exception: a phosphorous standard of 10 parts per billion; a
confirmation
that water for natural systems always comes first; and a secure funding
plan
to meet the first Billion-dollar commitment.  Not bad.  And we
acknowledge
the Everglades Coaltion's role in helping us get there.  This year, you
are
all Stewards of the Everglades.

Thanks for listening, and Happy New Year.

As you all bask in the sun enjoying your well deserved vacations I just
thought I'd let you know how things are going here. Yesterday a truck
pulled up in front of Holy Sacrament Church and " dumped out" 247 packing
boxes full of Pooh bear, The Gap, and Disney things. All part of this
wonderful Today show donation. The donation that never quits giving! Father
Hobbs was thrilled (not). I am no longer his favorite person. Today I just
returned from Sawgrass Mills where "GAMEWORKS" had a party for 30
Independent Living kids. Each rec'd $35.00 gift certificate to spend
anywhere in the mall, a 2 hour unlimited game card and a pizza party. When
I pulled in the driveway I was greeted by 105 boxes of books sitting in
front of my husband's garage door. They are wonderful coin collecting
books, very well done, and I'm sure my husband will be more than happy to
move them tonight when he gets in from work.
Something tells me his comment won't be "awesome!"
Luckily we don't have small, easily corrupted children.
This brings the number of Today Show donations to around the 160,000 pieces
level. Thank God for the Department of Corrections who saved my... life!
Enjoy your vacations!
Happy New Year

Good day Governor and Happy Holidays to you and your family. I hope you are enjoying a well deserved vacation. You have received many, excellent applicants for the Palm Beach County School Board appointment. Most applicants are interested in gaining an election advantage by this appointment. If you determine that a "caretaker" appointment is in order and you prefer to let all candidates compete for the position without advantage, then I may be able to help. I will not run for the seat in the next election. I will support the existing Superintendent, consult with Mrs. Gleason regularly and will not endorse a candidate this year. If you hope to help a future candidate by this appointment then I support your decision. As always, I hope you and your family all good things in the coming year and I am grateful you and the President are leading us during these troubled times. Tom McCracken

Dean Kamen called for you today. I took the call.

Two requests:

1. The First Competition is to be held in Orlando on April 25, 26, 27 -- he
asked that you set some time asked to come and address the kids again as you
did last year.   Tara, Governor very supportive of project.  Dean Kamen is a
big deal in every sense of the word -- invented the famous IT -- kind of a
Bill Gates of science/invention/technology.  

2. President Bush is coming to New Hampshire on Jan. 8 to give a speech on
education -- Dean is invited (he lives in NH), but thought it might be
appropriate to have the President mention the First program in his remarks
as something good happening with education/science. Wanted our help in
jogging Presidents memory of program.  I asked him to email down a one or
two pager that either you could share with President and/or we could share
with White House staff that would be working on trip.

By way of introduction, I have been in private practice as a physician in

charities.  I am writing this email in support of the appointment of Ed
Gonzalez to the Palm Beach County School Board.  I have known Ed for over 30
years in both a professional and a social capacity. Ed Gonzalez is the most
qualified of all applicants for this position.  None of the other applicants
have the community based experience that Ed Gonzalez will bring to the
Board. The Hispanic community deserves to have representation on the School
Board.

The current student Hispanic enrollment makes up 19% of the total district
student population.  With this in mind, I strongly recommend the appointment
of Ed Gonzalez to the School Board.

Sincerely yours,

I think we have also established new levels of access and confidence between
my office and yours.  This is going to help us as we work through some
important issues in the months ahead.  Three things come to mind:

First, how do we make sure that the water entering the Everglades gets
cleaned up?  The science has confirmed what many of you have long suspected:
phosphorous levels in the Everglades must be brought down to 10 parts per
billion.

I was pleased to personally appear before the Environmental Regulatory
Commission to make that recommendation.  It was an important step that I
will never forget!  But I also know full well that there is a big difference
between setting a standard and achieving it.

We all know that it will take decades before such an exacting standard can
be met across more than 2 million acres.  However, there will be no
backsliding; only forward progress with timely and measurable results.

Our challenge is to simultaneously ensure the retreat of cattails in the
Everglades Protection Area, while staving off the march of the red tile
roofs of development into the Everglades Agricultural Area.  This will best
be accomplished with new investments in water quality, while limiting new
and expensive opportunities for delay by lawyers and lobbyists.

The Second thing I want to mention is the agreement I need to sign with my
brother that promises Florida will reserve the water necessary for natural
systems before federal money is released for construction projects.

We will do this to make sure that federal money keeps flowing and projects
stay on schedule.  More importantly, we will do this because it is the right
thing to do.

If anyone questions Florida's resolve to reserve water for healthy
ecosystems, I direct your attention North to the Apalachicola River.  There
we have been in difficult discussions with our neighboring states over
equitable water allocations. Florida has been willing to give up substantial
amounts of water to avoid the uncertainties of litigation.  However, my
instructions have been clear: there is no compromise when it comes to the
minimum flows necessary to maintain the functional integrity of that River
and Bay environment.

The same holds true for the Everglades.  The difference is we don't have to
negotiate with another government, and the legal tools for water
reservations are already in place.

Finally, there is the need to keep paying the bills for Everglades
restoration.  We are starting the New Year off right:  All of the bills are
paid.  There is money in the savings account (trust fund).  And we have a
perfect credit record.  All of this in war-time while revenues have
temporarily fallen far short of the mark.

Given that, I found it amusing to read in the paper a recent quote from one
of your members that referred to "the Everglades Funding Problem."  Some
"problem!"  There are plenty of other programs in Florida government today
that wish they enjoyed the same strong position as the Everglades.

I suspect the real concern being expressed was, "WIll Everglades funding
always be in such great shape?"

Here again, the news is good.  Consider the fact that key legislators
(Republicans and Democrats; North and South Florida) have already indicated
their support to borrow money if ever needed to keep restoration on track.
I agree that we should be prepared to borrow the money if necessary.

However, I would go a step further.  If the Everglades are the priority we
say they are, then let's do everything we can first to make sure we don't
run out of money.  Let's use sound money management to make sure we have
revenues for this project that are secure and reliable -- and debt free.

Making Everglades restoration more expensive by taking on un-budgeted
interest payments makes it less likely, not more likely, that the project
will be completed on schedule.  This is particularly true if debt is taken
on in these early stages that will come due when we are in our peak spending
years in a decade.

In a few days I will for the third year in a row propose to fully fund the
Everglades at 100-million-dollars.  What will be different this year are the
sources of that revenue -- sources that are more reliable and more secure
than ever before.  It is a 3-part plan.

First, it continues the proven, reliable commitment of dedicating
25-million-dollars a year from our Florida Forever Program for Everglades
land acquisition.

Second, it provides a dedicated source of funds by capturing the growth in
document-stamp revenues in the state's subsidized housing program.  Because
of growing revenues, the housing program can remain fully-funded at current
levels while providing increasing amounts for Everglades restoration.
Beginning with 13-million-dollars a year in the early years, this dedicated
revenue source will grow to as much as 25-million-dollars by 2010.

Third, we will provide a secure source of funding by better managing
existing Florida Forever debt and by tapping excess document-stamp revenue
before it rolls over into General Revenue accounts.

Currently, as a condition of bonding, susbstantial document-stamp revenue is
held "in reserve" to help guarantee our Florida Forever debt.  We can free
this money up for the Everglades today by insuring our debt rather than
keeping cash in reserve.  Using surety bonds to meet our reserve
requirements on existing debt is a more cost-effective strategy for securing
additional resources than simply taking on additional new debt.

This, when combined with a commitment to direct a portion of the predictable
growth in document-stamp revenue
 directly into the Everglades Trust Fund before it is placed into a General
Revenue account, will make $50 to $60 million of reliable, debt-free dollars
available every year for the Everglades for the rest of this decade.

Total it all up, and we have our first Billion dollar commitment for the
Everglades from the State of Florida!

I applaud the broad political commitment in Florida to fund this project.
And I respect the need for contingencies -- including borrowing should that
ever become necessary.  It is an option we will never give up.  But with the
support of the Legislature and the Cabinet, we will first exercise every
option to make sure that reliable, secure, debt-free dollars are available
as needed to pay for our highest environmental priority.

We have come a long way together these past few years.  This year is no
exception: a phosphorous standard of 10 parts per billion; a confirmation
that water for natural systems always comes first; and a secure funding plan
to meet the first Billion-dollar commitment.  Not bad.  And we acknowledge
the Everglades Coaltion's role in helping us get there.  This year, you are
all Stewards of the Everglades.

Thanks for listening, and Happy New Year.

Dear Governor Bush,
Hope you are having a happy holiday. The reason for my e-mailing you today is because my son, Noah Cozine, who will be 4 years old on February 18th, has been on the waiting list for the MedWaiver for almost a year now. Besides being a very cute little boy, Noah was born with Spina Bifida. We went through the Early Intervention Program (with excellent results) and now Noah is a student in the ESE program in St. Lucie County. My husband is one of Fort Pierce Florida's bravest and finest (he is a police officer) and I work for the Early Intervention Program as a Family Resource Specialist. I have even had the pleasure of hearing you speak at the Family CAFE in 2000 in Orlando.
Noah is doing really well with the services he is getting, but Developmental Services can not help us very much. We really need to be on the Waiver so Noah can get the therapies and services he needs. 
Can you help us?
Thank you for taking the time to read this and have a Happy New Year.  <http://graphics.hotmail.com/emsmile.gif>

Dear Governor Bush:
The DOC has been vindictive because of what I have done to try to help.  It
makes me physically ill. 

I called your attention, to a young incarcerated man -C. Elliott (Tomoka)
who requested the Doctor's continuance of adult diapers -- because he was
soiling himself.  He was embarrassed and afraid of going out on the compound
because of the inability of control of his incontinence problem.  When I
first learned of this young man's problem, he was emotionally stable and
working very well in the educational department with one of my student.  All
he was requesting was for his adult diapers to be continued.  He wrote a
formal grievance to the DOC.  He also wrote a letter asking me for help in
this problem.

Since my involvement he was restricted to the medical department-not allowed
to communicate with his family--kept in medical confinement -- sent to
Butler C I for temporary stay (with diapers), and then onto Lake C I into a
Behavioral program...(without diapers)...because they his say incontinence
is all in his head.  (Did they ever have a specialist review his back and
spine injury?) His emotional well-being has been shattered.  The treatment
he has received has obliterated his emotional stability. 

You know, it really shouldn't matter why a person is incontinent, if
emotionally you need the security of adult diapers-you should have them. The
American civil rights act under section 504, disability act, suggests that
it is his right to have them.

The DOC has taken a young man with an incontinence problem and has
emotionally abused him to the point of causing his mental health to
disintegrate.  Would I tell you this if it wasn't true?

Is this what you were thinking should happen when you wanted the DOC to look
into this?

This Christmas will not be a happy one for this young man and his mother.

Governor Bush, thank you for allowing me to meet with you and outline what
the expansion of Florida service to the east coast communities means to
Amtrak and our rail passenger network. Thank you for your leadership and
support of this very important expansion. Your priority on this expansion
results in a reality for not only Amtrak, but the eight communities along
it's route. This expanded passenger rail service will offer an important
transportation option for those communities and I know will significantly
increase rider ship into Florida and allow Floridians another transportation
option when they are deciding to travel. The benefits of passenger rail
along Florida's East Coast will be exciting as it develops.

If you need any additional information, or if I can be of any additional
support to you or your staff on Amtrak Florida services, please do not

and increasing rail passenger services in Florida.

Mr. Nimer,

I have spoken with Chaplain Perry Davis, the Chaplain for the Tomoka
Horizons Program at TCI.  Chaplain Davis indicates that nothing has changed
in regards to the choosing and processing of inmates eligible for the Kairos
Horizons program.  From the beginning of the Faith-Based Residential Program
there have been minimum standards to participate in the program, with
Classification determining which inmates met those standards.

With the passage of Senate Bill 912 it was mandated that 80% of inmates who
participate in Faith-Based Residential Programming be within 3 years of
release.  The remaining 20% may include inmates with life sentences and
others as long as they meet the other minimal requirements (such as being in
open population and having 3 months free of DRs).  The Chaplain makes the
final decision as to who will participate in the program when he interviews
the applicant at the institution.

The Kairos Horizons Program is not moving to the Work Camp.  I believe the
misunderstanding here is that when potential program participants are
transferred to Tomoka they are initially "staged" at the work camp until an
available spot is open.  I have asked Chaplain Davis to speak personally
with Mr. Gott to clear up any misconceptions.  Mr. Gott is a valued
volunteer and does an excellent job as a "Godparent."

Thanks,

Will Smith

Dear Governor Bush
My name is Glen Gott and since it began I have been 
a "godparent" in the Kairos Horizons program at the 
Tomoka Correctional Institution here in Daytona Beach.
I heard a very distressing rumor the other day that the 
decision as to which inmates can apply for acceptance 
into the program has been taken out of the hands of the 
chaplain and is being decided by prison officials. It 
is also rumored that the program is going to be taken 
out of the main unit and transferred over to the work 
camp and application to the program will be limitted to 
only those inmates that have less than 3 years on their 
sentence.
First of all, haven't we learned yet that spiritual 
things belong in the hands of spiritual leaders? 1st 
Corinthians 2:14 says, "But the natural man receiveth 
NOT the things of the Spirit of God: for they are 
foolishness unto him: NEITHER can he (the natural man) 
know them, because they are SPIRITUALLY discerned."
Second, my "godson" has a life sentence and after 3

         Thanks for the response, Governor. Just do me one favor: Tell us 
you won't fall for the trap that Sen. McKay and the Democrats are setting 
for you. (And send me a copy of "The Florida Runaway Spending Graph" so I 
can start it circulating. You won't be blamed for the runaway spending; 
that started long before you were governor, it's generally seen to be more 
the function of the legislature, and you did yeoman's work in exercising 
the line-item veto anyway. So...where's the graph?)

I understand from your office that you cannot make the weekend in Punta

Merry Christmas!  Hope you and your family had a wonderful holiday.  My 
parents came up with tamales and  barbacoa.  I was in heaven!  I heard

Mr. Mica called this morning.  Sorry to bother you with this, but we do

yesterday 
is not too soon.

On Thursday, 12/20, Mr. Mica introduced an "Amtrak "spinoff" bill."  The
bill 
could force the liquidation or restructuring of Amtrak.  As a senior
member 
of the House Transporation Committee...it says a lot.  On Friday, 12/21,
the 
newspaper clips have you announcing plans to spend $82 million on
Amtrak.

He was quite upset that no one...but particularly Tom Barry never

told 
him I would look into it and get back.

His response was "I would invest in Eron, long before I would give a
dime to 
Amtrak." He was very upset; more so because "as senior Member of the 
Transportation Committee...you 'and he' are not coordinated."  

Stephanie and I will try to reach Tom tomorrow (I don't have his e-mail

Tim, what you failed to mention in your greetings to Everyone is that we have cut around $5 billion in cummulative taxes during my four years as governor. The state now takes the smallest amount of personal income since 1991. In effect, our efforts have erased the tax burden that grew in the 1990s. 

You are correct that spending has grown in Florida. This is true in spite of the close to $1 billion in spending vetoes during my first three years as governor.

The Deadly Political Trap
By Tim Condon
Tampa, Florida
December 27, 2001
For immediate release

         NOTE: What follows below is an explanation of the same old trap 
set for Republican officeholders by Democrats. It happens all the time. It 
made George H.W. Bush a one-term President. It made Bob Martinez a one-term 
Florida governor. And now the trap is laid for Jeb Bush. It was perfectly 
set this time by a RINO Republican (who used to be a Democrat and worked on 
Lawton Chiles campaigns), but its still the same old trick. It goes like 
this: The Democrats endlessly pressure an elected Republican to raise taxes 
for the good of the country or for the good of the state because its 
necessaryand its the right thing to do. The Republican, who is 
susceptible to this kind of entreaty because he or she actually cares about 
doing the right thing instead of playing political games, falls for the 
trap, turns against the Republican low-tax, small-government principles, 
and helps to raise taxes. Happily for the Democrats, that destroys his 
conservative voting base. Then the Democrats attack him in the election 
campaign anyway, as always, for favoring the rich and not doing enough. 
The result is that the Democratic voters all vote Democrat, and the 
Republican voters, disgusted with their turncoat candidate, either stay 
home or vote for an alternative candidate, thus handing the election to the 
Democrats. READ BELOW AND HEED!

         On December 18, 2001 newspaper headlines throughout the state of 
Florida heralded a  new master plan for increasing state taxes unveiled by 
state senate President John McKay.
         A Republican from Floridas west coast in Bradenton, McKay started 
out as a Democrat  who worked on campaigns for Democratic Senator (and 
later governor) Lawton Chiles in the 1980's, and thereafter held a staff 
position with Terrell Sessums, a Democrat and former speaker of the house 
in the Florida legislature.
         McKay has also made a name for himself over the last two years as 
the president of the Florida Senate in Tallahassee. During that time, while 
Jeb Bush has been governor, McKay has sometimes distinguished himself as 
quite partisan in a Democratic direction, as he opposed modest tax cuts and 
other proposals by Gov. Bush. Im not accountable to the Governor, he 
once said.
         Most recently McKay pulled a political stunt by shutting down the 
Florida Senate early, thus forcing the state House, led by a conservative 
Republican and still in session, to either accept bills written his way 
or reject them entirely. Because of such political shenanigans, among 
Republicans McKay has earned the sobriquet of RINO, an acronym for 
Republican In Name Only. Not unexpectedly, at the same time McKay has 
become a political darling of Floridas liberal-leaning media, not to 
mention the vastly outnumbered Democrats in the state legislature.
         Because Floridas state constitution requires a balanced budget, 
Gov. Bush was required to call two legislative sessions in 2001 to trim the 
budget (necessitated by falling state revenues which  to a degree are 
dependent on tourism which has plummeted in the wake of the World Trade 
Center disaster). As a result, the state legislature was forced to cut 
about $1 billion from a total state budget of about $50 billion.
         Now Senator McKay has unveiled a plan to increase taxes, 
essentially a green light over the long run for ever-larger state 
government. Expect to hear repeated media references to McKays courage 
and foresight, not to mention praise from Democrats statewide.
         McKays taxing plan is politically crafty. It features a current 
reduction of the state sales tax from six to four percent. It ends taxes on 
individual alcoholic drinks and continues the phase-out of the state 
intangibles tax, which is slated to expire anyway. It provides for 
three-fifths super-majorities in the future for the state legislature to 
raise the sales tax rate or expand sales tax exemptions. And it is being 
touted as revenue neutral, at least in the short term. But the real guts 
of the plan is that it ends most sales tax exemptions, including those on 
services such as advertising, lawyers fees, architects fees, and real 
estate charges, thus opening the taxation floodgates so the state 
government can take in many billions more dollars than it does now.
         Media stories noted in a muted way that Floridas legislative 
Democrats supported the McKay taxing plan, but their support will be 
low-key said one admiring newspaper article.  We have to be careful so 
were not portrayed as tax-and-spend liberals, said state representative 
Bob Henriquez of Tampa. There seemed little chance of that happening 
with  the Republican state senate president carrying water for higher 
taxing and spending.
         But what is most interesting about senator McKays maneuvering is 
not that he has turned his back on the traditional Republican themes of 
smaller government and less taxation. No. What is most notable is that his 
taxing plan lays a clever and deadly political trap for Governor Jeb Bush.
         Consider these facts: In the younger brother of the current 
President, some already see a potential future President. Smart and 
economically savvy, Jeb Bush is a member of the entrepreneurial wing of the 
Republican Party. Hes also married to a Hispanic woman and fluent in 
Spanish, attractive characteristics for an expanding and increasingly 
important bloc of voters. It has not been lost on Democratsin Florida and 
elsewherethat Jeb Bush could be a formidable future candidate for 
President of the United States. Thus, Democrats in Florida hope to destroy 
Bushs future potential by making him a one-term governor.
         With respect to the political trap being laid for Gov. Bush, 
consider the three possible outcomes: The plan for more taxes can win, be 
defeated, or pass in a modified state. Its fate lies first with the 
Republican-dominated state legislature. But more particularly, its fate 
lies in the hands of the governor himself. If Jeb Bush supports the plan, 
or some modification, it will most likely pass. If he opposes it, it will 
most likely  fail.
         If Gov. Bush supports McKays plan or some modification of it, the 
liberal media line will be paeans to his farsightedness, leadership, 
and courage. Butjust as his father did on the national stageby 
supporting higher taxes and bigger government he would alienate his 
conservative Republican base and be defeated in his re-election bid, to the 
relief and delight of Democrats everywhere. Truly a win-win situation for 
the Democrats.
         But what if Gov. Bush opposes the taxing plan, in any form? Then 
it will most likely go down to defeat, and he will be greeted by the hoots 
and catcalls of the Democrats and virtually all of Floridas left-leaning 
media outlets. As the conventional political wisdom goes, he would empower 
not only his Democratic opponents, but also alienate many of the states 
Republicans who are supposedly lusting after higher taxes and bigger state 
government.
         In other words, Jeb Bush, a rising star in the national Republican 
firmament, is damned if he does, and damned if he doesnt. Either way, it 
would seem, the Democrats and RINOs win.
         The plan seems so slick, and is being unveiled at such an 
opportune time, that its not too farfetched to foresee a triumphant 
Democratic Florida governor appointing Senator McKay to some important 
state post as a grand and magnanimous gesture of bipartisanship. It is even 
more interesting to note that McKay has announced that he wont run for his 
seat in the next election, which removes the potential distress of seeing 
what his own constituents think of his legislative shenanigans and big 
taxing plans. By doing that he has also effectively shielded himself 
from  political pressure by the state Republicans. Very slick.
         What is Jeb going to do? A victim of the failure to rein in state 
spending in the past  halcyon days of economic boom, Jeb Bush is now being 
blamed by Democrats and their media allies for economic conditions far 
beyond his control.
         What is Jeb going to do? In a typical lead paragraph after the 
Florida legislature finished a recent budget-cutting session, one newspaper 
article trumpeted McKays tax plan by writing, Hundreds of state workers 
are losing their jobs, school systems are canceling summer sessions and 
seventh periods, and at-risk youngsters are losing critical counseling 
services. Those are consequences of the $1 billion in budget cuts the 
Legislature made recently. In another article, the reporter intoned that, 
Gov. Jeb Bush must assure voters his tax cuts have not been damaging to 
the economy.
         Tax cuts? Damaging to the economy? This is the typical media line 
that Bush will have to deal with, and in Florida, as elsewhere, state media 
outlets often follow the lead of Democrat spinners.
         What is Jeb going to do? McKays tax-increase trap is almost 
exactly the same as that faced by former Florida Governor Bob Martinez, 
only the second Republican governor in modern state history. He was a 
one-term governor, thanks to the tax-and-spend issue, losing his 
re-election bid to Democrat Lawton Chiles after Martinez endorsed and the 
legislature passed a sweeping tax reform in the 1980's. Strikingly 
similar to McKays plan to increase sales taxes, the Martinez gaffe 
provoked such outrage that the state legislature hastily reversed it. 
During the following  two terms of Democrat Lawton Chiles there was nary a 
peep from the state capitol about increasing taxes. Lets face it, 
Democrats arent fools. And the economy was booming anyway, increasing the 
states tax-take every year.
         But now, like a gift from heaven for the states outnumbered 
Democrats, Republican John McKay reprises history, unveils what will 
eventually be a huge tax increase, and moves to put Jeb Bush in a deadly 
political bind.
         What is Jeb going to do? Well, there is good news: It is possible 
for Governor Bush to  escape the trap. The solution is powerful, visual, 
simple, and unarguable. All that is needed is a simple chart. It probably 
already exists. On this chart will be shown just two lines: One will show 
the growth of Florida population from, say, 1970, through to the present 
(it increased by about 235% over that time). And the other line will show 
yearly state government revenues/budgets during the same  period (which 
increased by thousands of percentage points).
         Just look at that chart! Saying Florida politicians have been 
spending like drunken sailors for 30 years would be a slander on drunken 
sailors. And the chartlike the now-famous Bush Country map showing how 
each county in the U.S. voted in the 2000 Presidential electionwill be 
everywhere.
         So let it begin. The Florida Runaway Spending Chart will appear 
on billboards, in newspapers, on flyers,  in advertising, on placards, on 
television, in magazines, on the Internet, on silk-screened T-shirts...let 
it be seen everywhere. And let the question be asked: Do we really need 
more state taxing and spending, like the Democrats and media are telling us?
         And then lets let the people of Florida decide.

just so you all know, it's my understanding that many (most?) media
outlets cannot read email with attachments and may not even RECEIVE
email that has attachments, for security reasons.  
	So, not only might forwarded copies with attached docs not make it, if
anyone bothers to do the "Florida Spending chart," (which someone needs
to do pronto) it will probably have to be put on a website, where the
media can be directed to a url in email articles to view a jpg or

The Deadly Political Trap
By Tim Condon
Tampa, Florida
December 27, 2001
For immediate release

         NOTE: What follows below is an explanation of the same old trap 
set for Republican officeholders by Democrats. It happens all the time. It 
made George H.W. Bush a one-term President. It made Bob Martinez a one-term 
Florida governor. And now the trap is laid for Jeb Bush. It was perfectly 
set this time by a RINO Republican (who used to be a Democrat and worked on 
Lawton Chiles campaigns), but its still the same old trick. It goes like 
this: The Democrats endlessly pressure an elected Republican to raise taxes 
for the good of the country or for the good of the state because its 
necessaryand its the right thing to do. The Republican, who is 
susceptible to this kind of entreaty because he or she actually cares about 
doing the right thing instead of playing political games, falls for the 
trap, turns against the Republican low-tax, small-government principles, 
and helps to raise taxes. Happily for the Democrats, that destroys his 
conservative voting base. Then the Democrats attack him in the election 
campaign anyway, as always, for favoring the rich and not doing enough. 
The result is that the Democratic voters all vote Democrat, and the 
Republican voters, disgusted with their turncoat candidate, either stay 
home or vote for an alternative candidate, thus handing the election to the 
Democrats. READ BELOW AND HEED!

         On December 18, 2001 newspaper headlines throughout the state of 
Florida heralded a  new master plan for increasing state taxes unveiled by 
state senate President John McKay.
         A Republican from Floridas west coast in Bradenton, McKay started 
out as a Democrat  who worked on campaigns for Democratic Senator (and 
later governor) Lawton Chiles in the 1980's, and thereafter held a staff 
position with Terrell Sessums, a Democrat and former speaker of the house 
in the Florida legislature.
         McKay has also made a name for himself over the last two years as 
the president of the Florida Senate in Tallahassee. During that time, while 
Jeb Bush has been governor, McKay has sometimes distinguished himself as 
quite partisan in a Democratic direction, as he opposed modest tax cuts and 
other proposals by Gov. Bush. Im not accountable to the Governor, he 
once said.
         Most recently McKay pulled a political stunt by shutting down the 
Florida Senate early, thus forcing the state House, led by a conservative 
Republican and still in session, to either accept bills written his way 
or reject them entirely. Because of such political shenanigans, among 
Republicans McKay has earned the sobriquet of RINO, an acronym for 
Republican In Name Only. Not unexpectedly, at the same time McKay has 
become a political darling of Floridas liberal-leaning media, not to 
mention the vastly outnumbered Democrats in the state legislature.
         Because Floridas state constitution requires a balanced budget, 
Gov. Bush was required to call two legislative sessions in 2001 to trim the 
budget (necessitated by falling state revenues which  to a degree are 
dependent on tourism which has plummeted in the wake of the World Trade 
Center disaster). As a result, the state legislature was forced to cut 
about $1 billion from a total state budget of about $50 billion.
         Now Senator McKay has unveiled a plan to increase taxes, 
essentially a green light over the long run for ever-larger state 
government. Expect to hear repeated media references to McKays courage 
and foresight, not to mention praise from Democrats statewide.
         McKays taxing plan is politically crafty. It features a current 
reduction of the state sales tax from six to four percent. It ends taxes on 
individual alcoholic drinks and continues the phase-out of the state 
intangibles tax, which is slated to expire anyway. It provides for 
three-fifths super-majorities in the future for the state legislature to 
raise the sales tax rate or expand sales tax exemptions. And it is being 
touted as revenue neutral, at least in the short term. But the real guts 
of the plan is that it ends most sales tax exemptions, including those on 
services such as advertising, lawyers fees, architects fees, and real 
estate charges, thus opening the taxation floodgates so the state 
government can take in many billions more dollars than it does now.
         Media stories noted in a muted way that Floridas legislative 
Democrats supported the McKay taxing plan, but their support will be 
low-key said one admiring newspaper article.  We have to be careful so 
were not portrayed as tax-and-spend liberals, said state representative 
Bob Henriquez of Tampa. There seemed little chance of that happening 
with  the Republican state senate president carrying water for higher 
taxing and spending.
         But what is most interesting about senator McKays maneuvering is 
not that he has turned his back on the traditional Republican themes of 
smaller government and less taxation. No. What is most notable is that his 
taxing plan lays a clever and deadly political trap for Governor Jeb Bush.
         Consider these facts: In the younger brother of the current 
President, some already see a potential future President. Smart and 
economically savvy, Jeb Bush is a member of the entrepreneurial wing of the 
Republican Party. Hes also married to a Hispanic woman and fluent in 
Spanish, attractive characteristics for an expanding and increasingly 
important bloc of voters. It has not been lost on Democratsin Florida and 
elsewherethat Jeb Bush could be a formidable future candidate for 
President of the United States. Thus, Democrats in Florida hope to destroy 
Bushs future potential by making him a one-term governor.
         With respect to the political trap being laid for Gov. Bush, 
consider the three possible outcomes: The plan for more taxes can win, be 
defeated, or pass in a modified state. Its fate lies first with the 
Republican-dominated state legislature. But more particularly, its fate 
lies in the hands of the governor himself. If Jeb Bush supports the plan, 
or some modification, it will most likely pass. If he opposes it, it will 
most likely  fail.
         If Gov. Bush supports McKays plan or some modification of it, the 
liberal media line will be paeans to his farsightedness, leadership, 
and courage. Butjust as his father did on the national stageby 
supporting higher taxes and bigger government he would alienate his 
conservative Republican base and be defeated in his re-election bid, to the 
relief and delight of Democrats everywhere. Truly a win-win situation for 
the Democrats.
         But what if Gov. Bush opposes the taxing plan, in any form? Then 
it will most likely go down to defeat, and he will be greeted by the hoots 
and catcalls of the Democrats and virtually all of Floridas left-leaning 
media outlets. As the conventional political wisdom goes, he would empower 
not only his Democratic opponents, but also alienate many of the states 
Republicans who are supposedly lusting after higher taxes and bigger state 
government.
         In other words, Jeb Bush, a rising star in the national Republican 
firmament, is damned if he does, and damned if he doesnt. Either way, it 
would seem, the Democrats and RINOs win.
         The plan seems so slick, and is being unveiled at such an 
opportune time, that its not too farfetched to foresee a triumphant 
Democratic Florida governor appointing Senator McKay to some important 
state post as a grand and magnanimous gesture of bipartisanship. It is even 
more interesting to note that McKay has announced that he wont run for his 
seat in the next election, which removes the potential distress of seeing 
what his own constituents think of his legislative shenanigans and big 
taxing plans. By doing that he has also effectively shielded himself 
from  political pressure by the state Republicans. Very slick.
         What is Jeb going to do? A victim of the failure to rein in state 
spending in the past  halcyon days of economic boom, Jeb Bush is now being 
blamed by Democrats and their media allies for economic conditions far 
beyond his control.
         What is Jeb going to do? In a typical lead paragraph after the 
Florida legislature finished a recent budget-cutting session, one newspaper 
article trumpeted McKays tax plan by writing, Hundreds of state workers 
are losing their jobs, school systems are canceling summer sessions and 
seventh periods, and at-risk youngsters are losing critical counseling 
services. Those are consequences of the $1 billion in budget cuts the 
Legislature made recently. In another article, the reporter intoned that, 
Gov. Jeb Bush must assure voters his tax cuts have not been damaging to 
the economy.
         Tax cuts? Damaging to the economy? This is the typical media line 
that Bush will have to deal with, and in Florida, as elsewhere, state media 
outlets often follow the lead of Democrat spinners.
         What is Jeb going to do? McKays tax-increase trap is almost 
exactly the same as that faced by former Florida Governor Bob Martinez, 
only the second Republican governor in modern state history. He was a 
one-term governor, thanks to the tax-and-spend issue, losing his 
re-election bid to Democrat Lawton Chiles after Martinez endorsed and the 
legislature passed a sweeping tax reform in the 1980's. Strikingly 
similar to McKays plan to increase sales taxes, the Martinez gaffe 
provoked such outrage that the state legislature hastily reversed it. 
During the following  two terms of Democrat Lawton Chiles there was nary a 
peep from the state capitol about increasing taxes. Lets face it, 
Democrats arent fools. And the economy was booming anyway, increasing the 
states tax-take every year.
         But now, like a gift from heaven for the states outnumbered 
Democrats, Republican John McKay reprises history, unveils what will 
eventually be a huge tax increase, and moves to put Jeb Bush in a deadly 
political bind.
         What is Jeb going to do? Well, there is good news: It is possible 
for Governor Bush to  escape the trap. The solution is powerful, visual, 
simple, and unarguable. All that is needed is a simple chart. It probably 
already exists. On this chart will be shown just two lines: One will show 
the growth of Florida population from, say, 1970, through to the present 
(it increased by about 235% over that time). And the other line will show 
yearly state government revenues/budgets during the same  period (which 
increased by thousands of percentage points).
         Just look at that chart! Saying Florida politicians have been 
spending like drunken sailors for 30 years would be a slander on drunken 
sailors. And the chartlike the now-famous Bush Country map showing how 
each county in the U.S. voted in the 2000 Presidential electionwill be 
everywhere.
         So let it begin. The Florida Runaway Spending Chart will appear 
on billboards, in newspapers, on flyers,  in advertising, on placards, on 
television, in magazines, on the Internet, on silk-screened T-shirts...let 
it be seen everywhere. And let the question be asked: Do we really need 
more state taxing and spending, like the Democrats and media are telling us?
         And then lets let the people of Florida decide.

Governor,

Merry Christmas!  Hope you and your family had a wonderful holiday.  My 
parents came up with tamales and  barbacoa.  I was in heaven!  I heard you 
had tamales too.  Ours were direct from TX...no better!  (sorry, Kathleen...)

Mr. Mica called this morning.  Sorry to bother you with this, but we do need 
to deal with it.  Mica would like a meeting or conference call, and yesterday 
is not too soon.

On Thursday, 12/20, Mr. Mica introduced an "Amtrak "spinoff" bill."  The bill 
could force the liquidation or restructuring of Amtrak.  As a senior member 
of the House Transporation Committee...it says a lot.  On Friday, 12/21, the 
newspaper clips have you announcing plans to spend $82 million on Amtrak.

He was quite upset that no one...but particularly Tom Barry never consulted 
with him.  Stephanie (our transportation person) and I had no clue.  I told 
him I would look into it and get back.

His response was "I would invest in Eron, long before I would give a dime to 
Amtrak." He was very upset; more so because "as senior Member of the 
Transportation Committee...you 'and he' are not coordinated."  

Stephanie and I will try to reach Tom tomorrow (I don't have his e-mail here 
at home).  When willl you be back in Tallahassee?  I'm at home  703/556-6917 
or reachable by cell 202/744-3686.

frequent travelers can obtain a special security card. This way people who 
volunteer to answer necessary questions can move through the screening at an

Subject: RE: Water

Dear Jeb,

Thank you for your thoughtful reply to my last e-mail message.  I
appreciate your taking the time to review my ideas and to respond.  I
agree that only you and I can finally resolve this matter, and I think
that we will have a much better chance to do so, if we continue to share
our thoughts.  In the hope that our dialogue can either produce
agreement by January 15, or otherwise allow us to find a basis for
extending the negotiations until they are successful, I would like to
set out some basic premises on which I am operating, so that we can try
to isolate why we are not in agreement.  Perhaps then we can find a
better solution.

	 Your observation that the Georgia reservoir levels under either
proposal will be higher than historical while Florida will have flows
below historical may sound fair, but it  oversimplifies what is truly
involved here.  Higher reservoir levels result primarily from limiting
hydropower production, something I believe Georgia will have to pay
dearly for, although I do note that the federal government has recently
suggested that it may be necessary for Florida and Alabama to share in
this cost, since hydropower curtailment is being used to support your
flows as well as our water supply needs.  The important point is that
higher reservoir levels are equally important to both of us because it
is only with these higher levels that your instream flow demands can be
met in dry periods.  If  you change the agreement to provide for lower
reservoir levels, Florida would be hurt as much as Georgia.  As for
lower than historical flows at the Florida line, it has always been
recognized in law and in our negotiations that Georgia, as an upstream
user, is entitled to make reasonable use of the waters that originate in
and flow through its borders, and this usage over time will necessarily
reduce downstream flows to some extent. The growth, development and
economic prosperity of our State (just like yours, which has grown even
more than Georgia) would not be possible otherwise, and we have both
supported economic development in our States. In the compact
negotiations, we are simply trying to determine together what is and
what is not reasonable at this time.

	 We seem to share the view that resolving our differences by
joint work, study and negotiations is preferable to leaving these issues
to be resolved by a special master appointed by the Supreme Court.  That
is why I am having difficulty understanding your insistence that these
historic discussions must be concluded by January 15.  Our Compact is
unique in delegating to the Governors the ability to determine what the
allocation formula should be.  There is no other Compact like this one,
and I do not want to let this opportunity slip from us because our teams
have not yet found the solution.  I know  that we can find one that
works for both us, and when we do, the Compact will require that  it be
respected by all the federal agencies, so long as it does not violate
federal law. 

	Here are some reasons that I think we cannot conclude
successfully by January 15:

 First, Georgia's concern about modeling errors, extended droughts, and
lower inflows, which you referred to as "soft" issues, is a direct
result of the increase in the flows which Florida has demanded.  You
will recall that your public proposal of May 15, which we indicated
would be acceptable to us, included target flows substantially below
those you are now requiring.  Your demands now are such that we must
focus on what can go wrong, what could cause your higher flows not to be
met--because those higher flows would endanger our future if we are not
protected against historic droughts or modeling input errors, etc. What
you see as our new-found "lingering hesitance" is a direct result of
Florida's demand for increased minimum flows. 
 
Secondly, your team has stated flatly that it will make no change in
your numbers.  We do not accept this as a reasonable way to negotiate,
but it has required us to re-analyze the circumstances that might cause
those numbers to be impossible to meet, and to see whether we can come
up with some agreement on an acceptable level of exceptions.  Your team
has offered a concept of augmentation caps, and we have always thought
that concept might be the key to make this work.  So far, we have not
been able to figure out  how this approach can work, but we are
certainly diligently pursuing it.  That is not easy, and it takes time
of technical people to get it done. 
 
Thirdly, within months, we will have the new information about the
1994--2000 period, and I believe it would be irresponsible to move
forward without this information.  This information is important to both
of us, and your team should recognize that.

Fourthly, I am informed that your team has proposed significant language
changes from your May 15 draft that are not acceptable in their current
form to us.  Our respective legal teams have not been able to resolve
these differences, but I am assured by our team that, given enough time
and commitment, this could be done.

	  I still believe that it would be in the mutual best interests
of all three States to extend these discussions for a year or so, to
take the politics out of them and to allow ample time to give each State
the assurances and protections it needs.  Whether or not you can accept
a one year extension, I nevertheless sincerely hope that you will not
prematurely terminate these discussions.  As I have suggested before,
all the constituencies in both States support the continued negotiations
(except perhaps the federal preference power customers and the
navigation interests, but I don't think we should side with them to the
exclusion of all the other important interests).

5.  A couple of minor points:  You mentioned Lake Lanier.  I thought we
were fully agreed on how Lake Lanier should operate.  On issue of the
dry year multiplier for agriculture, the National Resource Conservation
Service has no more information than the experts on which we rely.  And
we pay the price, not them, if their guess if wrong.

Jeb, I know our teams are still working together, and I am glad for
that.  Let's stay in touch and help make these discussions a success for
our States and their futures. Have a Merry Christmas and I hope we both have

a more prosperous New Year. I have had enough of sagging revenues.

Subject: RE: Water


Dear Roy,

I appreciate all your efforts on this water allocation matter.  I agree
with you that modeling by all interested parties will continue for
decades, and some refinements may be necessary based on improved
scientific information.  This is true today, and it will be true one
year from today.  For this reason, the Compact allows the parties to
review and modify the allocation formula.

In the end of course, we, not the modelers, must decide if the initial
allocation is equitable.  At this point, Florida has done all it can to
ensure not only an equitable allocation but one with an abundant margin
of protection for Georgia.  Georgia's reservoir levels will remain above
historical levels 80% - 90% of the time.  Florida has agreed to accept
flows that are below historical flows about 65% of the time.  This is
more than fair.

Please recognize that no scientist will be able to precisely describe
the impacts of lower flows in Florida because such low flows have never
before been experienced.  This made our decision to accept lower than
historical flows a very difficult one.  The only reason Florida agreed
to accept an unprecedented low flow is to avoid the uncertainties of
litigation.

I am concerned that your team's lingering hesitance to endorse an
allocation formula that fully meets all of Georgia's own projected water
demand for the next half century suggests that Georgia is actually
seeking to consume substantially more water than ever discussed in our
work over the past 4 years.  Why, for example, does Georgia insist on a
dry year irrigation multiplier of 2.2 when the National Resource
Conservation Service has established a dry year multiplier of 1.3 - 1.5?
Even in the driest of years, the level of irrigation proposed by Georgia
would drown the crops.

My concern is compounded by the fact that after 4 years and 4
extensions, Georgia is raising "soft" issues of uncertainty such as
global warming.  It is widely recognized that climate change cycles
occur over a time span far greater than a 50-year term.  Further, some
studies have suggested that global warming is predicted to cause slight
increases in precipitation.  This new issue is clearly not one to take
us off course now. 

I was also surprised that your team informed you that water storage at
Lanier is not critical to Florida.  In times of low flow, the
contribution from Lanier is necessary to maintain the state-line flows.
There can be no allocation agreement without considering the operation
of all the federal reservoirs, including Lanier.  I thought this has
been well understood by all parties from the beginning of our
negotiations.

I understand that our staffs met this week to review modeling efforts
demonstrating that Georgia can meet Florida's state-line flows 100% of
the time, thus achieving perfect compliance while maintaining the
reservoirs in a healthy condition.  This held true using both the
Florida and Georgia models and assumptions about the future.

Your team requested some additional information, which the Florida team
will provide asap.  We have come such a long way in this process.  After
the New Year, let's plan on resolving this thing one way or the other.

Jeb

Jeb:

Thanks for your message.  First, I want to assure you that I am fully
dedicated to finding a solution that works for both of us.  I agree that
we have made a great deal of progress and are down to a much smaller set
of issues, but of course the ones left are the hardest ones.  The very
nature of the most recent development, which in this case turned out to
be a positive one, is what makes me nervous, namely, the discovery at
this very late date of an input error in the Corp's model.  What if
there are other errors, or major climate changes such as a continuing
warming trend that further reduces inflows of water?  On that point, I
believe we are about to receive new information from the Corps covering
the period from 1994--2000, which will allow our teams to see how our
formulas would have fared in this difficult period.  But I don't think
that this information will be available until February at the
earliest--after the current deadline.

We (both our team and yours) are looking for a way to provide Georgia
with a comfortable margin of safety, while preserving necessary flows
for Florida that can be reliably assured.  Neither of us wants to make
or receive commitments that are not needed or that cannot be met.  I
understand we are still waiting to meet with your experts, which your
team offered several weeks ago, to hear their explanation for the
increases in your minimum flow demands.  And, Jeb, keep in mind that
healthy reservoir levels are critical to both of us, not just Georgia,
in low flow periods.

I hope we can reach final agreement by January 15, but I am skeptical.
My email was intended to suggest a back-up plan if final agreement is
not reached by then.  The Compact provides the best possible vehicle for
a negotiated settlement among the states.  I am not aware of a single
constituent who wants the Compact to expire without agreement.  Some of
your strongest stakeholders are even now putting forth new suggestions
for consideration in an almost frantic attempt to ensure that we will
keep working together.  I think we should keep working together until we
find the answer.  We should not give up, but at the same time, I am
concerned with the potential that political considerations could
interfere with sound policy decisions if we try to finalize an agreement
with three re-election campaigns going on.  Alabama wants to extend the
ACT and the ACF for a year.  I think that is worth considering, and I
hope that you and I will talk directly before you make a final decision
to abandon the negotiating process.

With respect to the federal litigation, please remember that we did not
start this litigation, but filed our case only after the federal power
customers raised all the critical issues affecting Georgia in another
case in Washington, D.C.  We did not want to be in Court, as your folks
know.  More importantly, we are asking for no more water in court that
we are asking for in our discussions with Florida.  And, it has already
been acknowledged in the draft agreements that Lake Lanier is not to be
used to support flows at the Florida line and that in fact Florida is
looking to the lower reservoirs for its flows.  Finally, this litigation
does not involve an allocation of waters between Florida and Georgia.
Anything this Court decides will still be subject to challenge by
Florida any time Florida desires.

I look forward to seeing you and talking with you about these and other
important matters affecting our great States.

Merry Christmas to you and your family.

Dear Roy,

Thank you for the note.  I understand that our teams are getting closer
and that a recent model correction improves your reservoir levels.  Good
news for you.  In fact, both states' proposals are now predicting that
Lanier will be above its historic levels 90% of the time, while the
lower federal reservoirs will be above their historic levels 80% of the
time.  

As I understand it, the only real question remaining is unrelated to any
modeling or scientific issue.  The only remaining question is, does
Georgia need a margin of error so large that it allows for Georgia to
use substantially more water than any of the states have modeled?  If
so, let's be honest, and not prolong it.  This decision won't be any
different a year from now.

Roy, this federal litigation also troubles me.  I think that Florida's
interests are not served by delaying this matter while Georgia litigates
important issues without us.

I hope you and your family are going to have a wonderful Christmas. Are
you going to pass out presents this year?

Governor - see attached letter, from the wife of a dying man whose
potential life-saving operation is being denied by BC/BS.  Would you be
willing to send a quick e-mail to Mike Hightower?  Key paragraph:
 
I spoke on the phone with Dr. Lestage, the vice president of BCBS.  He
told me the contract gives him the discretion to allow my husband to
have this procedure.  In fact, according to our patient advocate at MD
Anderson at least seven Blue Cross Blue Shields around the country,
including Federal BCBS have paid for this procedure.  Dr. Lestage
promised me he would look into why the seven other adjusters permitted
the procedure, but he clearly did not do this when he denied our third
appeal. (He denied the appeal before he contacted the seven or so
adjusters).

is this true? I don't remember a $10 million cut.
 
State slashes services for low-income AIDS patients

The Associated Press (Ran in the Ft. Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel)

December 25, 2001

ST. PETERSBURG  A special Medicaid program for 6,000 of the state's sickest 

AIDS patients is facing a $10 million cut, nearly half its funding.

Project AIDS Care is losing its funding as part of the more than $1 billion 

cut from the state budget. The program was designed to save the state money 

by allowing poor patients with full-blown AIDS to continue living, and to 

die, in their own homes, rather than in nursing homes or hospitals.

Officials with hospice groups and other agencies contend the reductions are 

shortsighted and likely will force more patients into institutions, costing 

more in the long run.

"I'm just at a complete loss. I am convinced somebody in Tallahassee does 

not understand the ramifications," said Lorraine Langlois, executive 

director of Metropolitan Charities Inc. in St. Petersburg, which has 250 

clients in the program.

Medicaid administrator Bob Maryanski said agency staff tried to choose cuts 

that would disrupt patients as little as possible.

"The last thing we wanted to do was to cut services to this population," 

Maryanski said. "It's a fragile population, and most of the patients who use 

this service have serious medical problems. They can't do a lot for 

themselves."

As proposed, the cuts would eliminate five in-home services: physical 

therapy, housekeeping, health assessment, pest control and therapeutic 

massage. Several more would be significantly reduced, including in-home meal 

service.

But the toughest loss, advocates say, would be a two-thirds cut in case 

management.

For sick people who rely on public assistance, a case manager helps the 

patient navigate the bureaucracy and find free or low-cost services to 

augment government aid.

Currently, Medicaid pays case managers $44 per hour. A typical case manager 

has about 40 clients and spends about three hours a month on each, Langlois 

said.

Under the proposed cuts, Medicaid will pay just $50 per client per month. 

That will force agencies to fire some case managers and give the rest more 

clients than they can adequately serve, officials said.

Hello Governor:

Richard Parsons was recently elevated to CEO of media concern America Online/Time Warner. Mr. Warner is black and a Republican. Perhaps you should solicit from Mr. Parsons and AOL/Time Warner a donation for FAMU for their business school, which is seeking full accreditation, or for their journalism school, which needs a new building. If successful, it could not only help the state university system but also serve as a bit of positive politicking, outreach if you will, as well for your administration and Republicans, especially black Republicans, in general. Also, Mr. Parsons would be an excellent choice to fill the vacancy on FAMU's Board of Trustees Thank you.

Dear Governor Bush,

I wanted to take a moment to share with you  a page from our  website.
A
link to view the page where you are featured is included, along with a
word
file of the same. AeANET will relaunch on January 2, 2002 with
completely
updated content and greater flexibility.

Governor Bush, the AeA, as the nation's oldest and largest high tech
trade
association, works quite effectively with governors throughout the
United
States.  In Florida, the AeA has two offices.  One in South Florida and
one
in Orlando.  We hope that you will look to us for information concerning
the high tech industry on a local, regional, state, national and
international basis.  The AeA has over 3500 member companies
representing
over 3.5 million high tech workers.  Fortune magazine ranked the AeA as
the
60th most effective lobbying organization on Capitol Hill. The AeA was
the
only technology association on that list.  Earlier this year, the AeA
hosted a meeting for 28 technology company CEOs with President Bush (I
know
you are well acquainted with our President)  to discuss the need for
legislation granting TPA.  Included in that number were several Florida
CEOs.  AeA led the coalition of high tech industry concerns that was
instrumental in securing a victory in the House for TPA.  We are working
hard to make this happen in the Senate as well.

In addition to our efforts on the Hill, the AeA has lobbyists in
fourteen
states, including Florida and in Florida we formed the AeA Tech Florida
PAC
to allow technology companies to support candidates that are pro-high
tech.

Governor Bus, the AeA is here in Florida to promote the interests of the
high tech industry, one that already plays a vital role in Florida's
economy as evidenced by the fact that over 36% of all Florida's exports
are
from the high tech industry (Source: Cyberstates 2001).

I ask that you include the AeA as part of your ITFlorida initiative.  We
can be a tremendous resource for this group.

I am honored to extend an invitation to you to attend our Technology
Executive Forum: A Conversation with Florida's Technology Leaders, in
Orlando Florida on February 21, 2002.  This event is for CEOs of
technology
companies across the High Tech Corridor.  It will be held at Portofino
Bay
Hotel from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. We have several of our industry's
leaders presiding over a panel discussion on the business climate for
high
tech companies in Florida.  We would be pleased to have you address the
group as well to discuss your vision of Florida's high tech future.   It
is
anticipated that we will have 100 - 150 CEOs in attendance.

My best regards to you and your family for a wonderful holiday and peace
and prosperity in the New Year.  I hope that you will call upon the AeA
to
be of service to the great state of Florida.

Subject: SR 200 law suit

Several weeks ago, I emailed you about the county;s plan to sue DOT for the
miserable contract administration on SR 200 west of Ocala -- in the heart of
thousands of good GOP voters!
Here is today's editorial from the star banner from their on line site . . .
. Merry Christmas and may god bless the Bush family and all Florida. pwf

		Our Opinion Editorial for 12/24/2001 Push comes to shove on SR 200   It's
amazing what a law suit can do? Consider the legal action recently taken by
the Marion County Commission to sue the Florida Department of Transportation
over work that had slowed to a snail's pace along State Road 200. Suddenly,
the highway has become a beehive of activity, say those who requested that
the county sue.  "It looks like a real road project now,'' said Glenn Lane,
one of those who approached the commission about the problem. "Before, it
looked like if workers didn't have anything else to do, they sent them over
here to SR 200. The law suit may very well have had a beneficial affect."
At the urging of Lane and business owners who ran out of patience with the
ongoing construction of additional lanes along SR 200, the Marion County
Commission went where no other county had gone before on such an issue. It
decided enough was enough. The commission is suing Florida's Department of
Transportation. People and businesses along SR 200 have been inconvenienced
for so long that some businesses have closed down.  But the main bone of
contention has been White Construction. On June 14, 1999, the DOT awarded
the $17.8 million contract to White. But DOT officials have acknowledged
this company has had a dismal record on road projects. Substandard work and
chronic delays have put White Construction in ill-favor with the state and
county.  Still, the DOT claims its hands are often tied because of the
state's competitive bid process. Also, DOT officials say they have little
power to put pressure to White. The DOT can fine the company for every day
it's late completing a project. But even that hasn't brought results. White
has simply filed counter claims  often prevailing. Even an $850,000 bonus
to complete SR 200 by this past June failed to move White forward on the
construction.  Recently, Steve Homan, public information officer for DOT
District 5 in DeLand, made an implied threat in a letter to the editor of
this newspaper.  "The county's suit could have significant negative
consequences with regard to future funding of transportation projects; is
essentially a criticism of the department for obeying the laws; damages
relationships on hosts of other projects throughout the county; represents
an unnecessary and pointless expense for Marion County taxpayers and the
FDOT; and can accomplish absolutely nothing with regard to accelerating work
on State Road 200,'' Homan wrote.  Interesting, in light of the work pace
suddenly picking up along the highway.  It does not bode well with a
community when the DOT suggests looking at this county with disfavor when it
comes to state road projects.   Lane said Homan's letter simply, "proves
just how negligent they (DOT) are. If you say anything about it, then they
say they won't give us any projects. That they think they have the right to
do anything they want with taxpayer's money, shows their arrogance. It's
their obligation to help fund roads in Marion County. The DOT's cavalier
attitude is heinous."   Lane believes the state will avoid going to trial
over this issue because it would send a negative message to counties
experiencing similar problems with contractors hired by the state. Other
county's might also decide to stop accepting DOT excuses and file suit.  The
DOT's feathers are no doubt ruffled, but that's a small consequence compared
to the misery drivers have endured year after year on SR 200. Marion County
is tired of excuses

he chose to be a mechanic.  Not everyone is an Einstein or a Hemingway and 
who cares.  

My husband and I are both college graduates-I am a retired teacher and my 
husband has his degree in education but retired from Sears.  He was a 
department manager.  

I have five children, ranging in age from 49 to 38.  They all attended 
college but there is not a graduate among them.  However, they are all wage 
earners and living rather well.

  My oldest daughter recently became an Assistant Manager at Washington 
Mutual. 
She has an AA degree from Miami-Dade Community College.  She worked for 
Eastern Airlines but chose to be a stay home Mom for her three children.  Now 
she is working to put her three children through college.

 My oldest son has an AA degree but due to some physical handicaps, he does 
not have an outstanding job.  He works for Publix and he gives a good days 
work and the customers love him.

My second son works for the Assurant Group, formerly American Bankers 
Insurance Group.  He joined the Marine Corps when he was 17, graduated from 
Boot Camp as Honor Man and served four years in the corps.  When he returned 
home, he went to work for Southeast Banks.  Not knowing a bit from a byte, he 
was a night manager in their Data Processing department with expertise in 
Disaster Recovery.  He attended the community some but does not have an 
entire year to his credit.  

My middle daughter was employed by Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines for 22 years. 
 She joined them when she was 19.  As a result of the 9/11 attack, she was 
severed in October.  When she left, she was earning $24.00 an hour or in that 
bracket.  The department in which she was working was consolidated with 
another department and only one person out of five was retained by RCCL.  She 
is receiving a substantial severance pay and is planning to hone her computer 
skills after Christmas by attending computer classes.

My youngest daughter is a lieutenant with Miami-Dade Fire Rescue.  She is a 
paramedic and earning a salary equal to her brother-in-law, a lieutenant with 
Miami Dade Police department, holding a Master's degree in Law enforcement.  
She attended Florida State but did not graduate because she was too immature 
to go away from home.  

We were not eligible, at that time, for financial because we owned our home.  
This was 1981.  Of course, my husband is a first generation American of 
Portuguese descent.  His parents came to this country from Madeira Island.  
Our disadvantage was that we are white and not considered Hispanic even 
though our last name is Silva.  

I may be drifting from my original thoughts.  I apologize.  I am so 
distressed to read about the lack of minorities in college.  Did anyone think 
that maybe they didn''t want to go or did not apply themselves after they got 
there?  

My point, I suppose, is that where there is a will, there is a way.  I 
started college in 1948 at the University of Miami because my grandmother 
paid for one semester.  Then due to transportation and finances, I did not go 
back the following semester.  I received a grant from the University of Miami 
for another year of college because they were trying to encourage Dade County 
students to attend the UM.  But I met my husband and after deciding to marry. 
did not feel right about accepting more money.

We raised the five children.  I did attend another semester and with two 
years of college was able to become a substitute teacher.  In 1962, I 
received an NDEA loan and completed two years of college in 14 months.  I 
graduated from the University of Miami in August 1963, a month before I 
delivered my fifth child.  I taught for 29 years at the school where I did my 
student teaching.  I am now retired and enjoying my grandchildren.

I just feel that my family is a good example of what one can do when one 
wants to do.  College is not necessarily the path for everyone.  The world 
needs some Indians, we can't all be chiefs.

Thank you for taking time to read this.  You are doing a great job as 
Governor.  I am at ease with you and President Bush at the helms of our state 
and nation.  

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

Sales taxes are regressive. It would take a man of great 
stature, a man of the people, to institute a fair and 
equitable income tax. I would pay my share. The budget 
could be balanced without unfairly depriving education, 
health and the elderly.
Are you the man?

Pam...am on holiday vacations...thus my home e-mail. 

Purchase valuation was based on private sector real estate company
estimation as part of late 1999 study (which recommended we purchase in
lieu of continued leasing or moving, most cost-effective alternative). 

Valuation was by the Staubach Group (out of Texas I believe).  They were
asked to give us an appreciated valuation for 2002 purchase...their
estimation was $36.1 million (which we added 10% to for submission to
Congress knowing the existing owner would never settle for actual
valuation...from past experience he probably wouldn't have accepted 10%
over either...would have been up to courts to make him accept fair
valuation...nevertheless, that's where we came up with the $40 million
almopst requested from Congress last year).  The valuation by Staubach
Group was based on actual recent sales of similar office space and raw,
unimproved land in the local market.   

We have not had a newer valuation done (though we are in the midst of
trying to get a validation on the old valuation...this probably won't be
completed until April  2002). 

As an aside, Beacon Council thinks the cost/value is a bit high...they
also would love to work a fallback option whereby we (federal
government) get a great deal to use the Ryder headquarters across the
street...since they are looking to move to a smaller building in 16
months). 

Hope this provides the info you needed.  Happy holidays.

The Governor wants to know the following: 

How was cost and value of SOUTHCOM land and headquarters established? 

On the $40 million purchase figure floating around Congress last
year...how 
did that number come about? 

What is market value now?  How is this figure derived?

Subject: Costs for SOUTHCOM HQ 



Current lease costs.  Total for HQ property is $3.1 million per year.
Total 
for additional space (office/warehouse) in the area, $1.2 million per
year. 

~ HQ Building.  Current lease expires Feb 2008.  Lease costs are 
approximately $2 million per year. 

~ Land.  Land for security buffer surrounding the HQ (19+ acres) is 
currently has authorityto lease (through condemnation proceedings) 
year-to-year through Feb 2008 for $1-$1.1 million per year. 

~ State land.  Land from State to complete security buffer (15 acres) is
$0 
per year for 50 years. 
to leased and land Purchase. 

~ Additional neighboring leases.  Currently a patchwork of seven 2 - 5
year 
leases to supplement HQ space at a cost of $1.2 million per year.  These

leases account for 30% of our total office space, and there is a small 
amount for warehouse.  Ideally we would develop an Annex next the the 
current HQ and eliminate these other leases.     

Purchase. 

~ The last time DoD considered pursuing authorization to purchase (last 
year...for FY02 purchase) the cost was estimated to be $40 million.   

~ This would have purchased the HQ building and land.  A logical
follow-on 
would have been to develop the Annex structure at a cost of around $16 
million.   

~ As an aside...truth in lending requires that I say, it is likely
purchase 
would require some type of court proceeding based on the experience with
the 
buffer land.  In the case of the buffer land the Corps of Engineers
(they 
are our agent for real estate issues) offered 125% of valuation for the
land 
lease but the owner countered at approximately 200% of value for best
offer. 
Thus the Corps had to execute a lease through condemnation (whereby the 
courts ensure fair value compensation to the owner).

thank you for writing. I am not aware of the specifics of the expenditure you mention but my fight against the legislature on member projects has been ongoing since I have been governor. I have vetoed close to $1 billion of projects that did not go through the proper process. For the record, the per pupil expenditure this year is higher than last. The cut in the budget was from a significant increase.

Dear Governor Bush,  I have a question for you. I heard a radio talk show person yesterday here in Orlando going on and on about an airplane that is being refurbished to be on display at the entrance to the Sanford Int Airport in Sanford. He was totally upset because he said so much money had been cut from the state budget, including $300 million dollars from the education budget, and yet you did not veto the bill for the state government to pay $150,000 for the refurbishing of this airplane, just for a momento to the veterans who flew in it, and for an unnecessary display.  I would also tend to think of this as an extravagence, when there are so many higher priorities. Please let me know what you know of this expenditure and if the information is true. This radio personality reaches alot of people in our area and has alot of influence on how people react to the issues.  Thank you for your time. Teresa Young.

Dear Governor Bush,

I wanted to take a moment to share with you  a page from our  website.  A
link to view the page where you are featured is included, along with a word
file of the same. AeANET will relaunch on January 2, 2002 with completely
updated content and greater flexibility.

Governor Bush, the AeA, as the nation's oldest and largest high tech trade
association, works quite effectively with governors throughout the United
States.  In Florida, the AeA has two offices.  One in South Florida and one
in Orlando.  We hope that you will look to us for information concerning
the high tech industry on a local, regional, state, national and
international basis.  The AeA has over 3500 member companies representing
over 3.5 million high tech workers.  Fortune magazine ranked the AeA as the
60th most effective lobbying organization on Capitol Hill. The AeA was the
only technology association on that list.  Earlier this year, the AeA
hosted a meeting for 28 technology company CEOs with President Bush (I know
you are well acquainted with our President)  to discuss the need for
legislation granting TPA.  Included in that number were several Florida
CEOs.  AeA led the coalition of high tech industry concerns that was
instrumental in securing a victory in the House for TPA.  We are working
hard to make this happen in the Senate as well.

In addition to our efforts on the Hill, the AeA has lobbyists in fourteen
states, including Florida and in Florida we formed the AeA Tech Florida PAC
to allow technology companies to support candidates that are pro-high tech.

Governor Bus, the AeA is here in Florida to promote the interests of the
high tech industry, one that already plays a vital role in Florida's
economy as evidenced by the fact that over 36% of all Florida's exports are
from the high tech industry (Source: Cyberstates 2001).

I ask that you include the AeA as part of your ITFlorida initiative.  We
can be a tremendous resource for this group.

I am honored to extend an invitation to you to attend our Technology
Executive Forum: A Conversation with Florida's Technology Leaders, in
Orlando Florida on February 21, 2002.  This event is for CEOs of technology
companies across the High Tech Corridor.  It will be held at Portofino Bay
Hotel from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. We have several of our industry's
leaders presiding over a panel discussion on the business climate for high
tech companies in Florida.  We would be pleased to have you address the
group as well to discuss your vision of Florida's high tech future.   It is
anticipated that we will have 100 - 150 CEOs in attendance.

My best regards to you and your family for a wonderful holiday and peace
and prosperity in the New Year.  I hope that you will call upon the AeA to
be of service to the great state of Florida.

Subject: High Tech Legislator of the Year Award from AeA


Dear Governor Bush,

I wanted to take a moment to share with you  a page from our  website.  A
link to view the page where you are featured is included, along with a word
file of the same. AeANET will relaunch on January 2, 2002 with completely
updated content and greater flexibility.

Governor Bush, the AeA, as the nation's oldest and largest high tech trade
association, works quite effectively with governors throughout the United
States.  In Florida, the AeA has two offices.  One in South Florida and one
in Orlando.  We hope that you will look to us for information concerning
the high tech industry on a local, regional, state, national and
international basis.  The AeA has over 3500 member companies representing
over 3.5 million high tech workers.  Fortune magazine ranked the AeA as the
60th most effective lobbying organization on Capitol Hill. The AeA was the
only technology association on that list.  Earlier this year, the AeA
hosted a meeting for 28 technology company CEOs with President Bush (I know
you are well acquainted with our President)  to discuss the need for
legislation granting TPA.  Included in that number were several Florida
CEOs.  AeA led the coalition of high tech industry concerns that was
instrumental in securing a victory in the House for TPA.  We are working
hard to make this happen in the Senate as well.

In addition to our efforts on the Hill, the AeA has lobbyists in fourteen
states, including Florida and in Florida we formed the AeA Tech Florida PAC
to allow technology companies to support candidates that are pro-high tech.

Governor Bus, the AeA is here in Florida to promote the interests of the
high tech industry, one that already plays a vital role in Florida's
economy as evidenced by the fact that over 36% of all Florida's exports are
from the high tech industry (Source: Cyberstates 2001).

I ask that you include the AeA as part of your ITFlorida initiative.  We
can be a tremendous resource for this group.

I am honored to extend an invitation to you to attend our Technology
Executive Forum: A Conversation with Florida's Technology Leaders, in
Orlando Florida on February 21, 2002.  This event is for CEOs of technology
companies across the High Tech Corridor.  It will be held at Portofino Bay
Hotel from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. We have several of our industry's
leaders presiding over a panel discussion on the business climate for high
tech companies in Florida.  We would be pleased to have you address the
group as well to discuss your vision of Florida's high tech future.   It is
anticipated that we will have 100 - 150 CEOs in attendance.

My best regards to you and your family for a wonderful holiday and peace
and prosperity in the New Year.  I hope that you will call upon the AeA to
be of service to the great state of Florida.

Dear Honorable Jeb Bush:
 
Would like to wish you, your family and your staff and Happy Holiday and Best Wishes for the New Year.
As I/we all know, you as any representative of the people have a challenging job, I thank you for listening to my concerns/views of the last year. As we may sometimes have different views, we must keep an open mind to the opinions of others. I thank you for your good service in always responding to me.
 
Lastly, on a safety note, driving yesterday on I-75, from Venice North to the Skyway Bridge, I must say in my 40 years of driving, and proud to say with a 100% safe driver record, we clearly need more law enforcement on our highways. It is sad that some drivers don't respect the posted speed limit and other traffic laws. I must say, I  have never seen it so bad with speeders [going the posted 70MPH, many fly by and must be going 80 or more! Many seen cutting in and out of traffic and coming up behind you to close, etc. Suggestion, anything you could do to provide more assistance to our hard working State Patrol division as in more enforcement officers and radar units would be wonderful. Without question, we need to get the bad drivers off the road to include those that are drunk or reckless. Just an idea for your consideration.
God Bless and thank you for your interest. Norm Lupo

"For those of us who lived through these events, the only marker  we'll ever need is the tick of a clock at the 46th minute of the eighth hour of the 11th day. We will remember where we were and  how we felt. We will remember the dead and what we owe them. We  will remember what we lost and what we found."

Thanksgiving was hard enough. And now there are the dozens of little rituals that make up a Christmas, each one a sugared plum with a bitter center.  So Elizabeth Kovalcin knelt before her fireplace in Hudson, N.H., to hang up stockings labeled with names: one for Rebecca, 4; one for Marina, 1 1/2; and one for herself. But, surveying her work, she realized she would have to put up one more. The one that read "David," the name of her husband, who died on Sept. 11.  "I could not not have it up," she said.  Rebecca, spotting the arrangement, made her change it once more, insisting, "I want Daddy next to me."  Full  <http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/16/nyregion/16WIDO.html> story

Gov. Bush:
 
Hi, it's Matt Gomez in Orlando. I want to keep you up-to-date on some recent technology deals in higher education signed by my company, CollegisEduprise, Inc. ( www.collegiseduprise.com <http://www.collegiseduprise.com/> ) in the past several weeks.
 
As you may already know by having met Tom Huber, our president and COO, CollegisEduprise is based in Maitland and works exclusively with colleges and universities to improve technology on campus and online. We are proud to announce two recent deals with Salt Lake Community College and Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania that have netted $29 million in contract revenues for our corporation, and should stand to raise our profile in Central Florida and beyond as an industry leader: http://www.collegiseduprise.com/root/pages/29.asp
 
Our efforts prove that there is a wealth of talent and opportunity in our state and we welcome the chance to spread the word of our successes so many other Florida companies and entrepreneurs may be inspired to do the same.
 
During your next Central Florida visit, we'd love to have you stop by our offices to view our Network Operations Center, which provides security monitoring systems for more than 120 higher education clients, and to meet the people who are fine examples of how a Florida high tech company is helping to improve educational opportunities for people throughout the world.
 
Please accept my best wishes and blessings for a joyous Christmas holiday for the entire family.

Governor Bush,

Thank you for taking the time to meet with us on Wednesday.  It was an
honor to spend time with you.  I am and will remain a strong supporter.

I have asked my staff to review the impact that the proposed tax will have
on our business.  I will forward you that information after the first of
the year.  Needless to say, it will make it more costly to do business in
Florida.

With all that has happened this year,  please accept my best wishes to you
and your family  for a happy, peaceful Christmas and a most prosperous New
Year.

Kind regards,

Bill Simon
President,  GuinnessUDV Southeast

Dear Governor Bush
My name is Glen Gott and since it began I have been 
a godparent in the Kairos Horizons program at the 
Tomoka Correctional Institution here in Daytona Beach.
I heard a very distressing rumor the other day that the 
decision as to which inmates can apply for acceptance 
into the program has been taken out of the hands of the 
chaplain and is being decided by prison officials. It 
is also rumored that the program is going to be taken 
out of the main unit and transferred over to the work 
camp and application to the program will be limitted to 
only those inmates that have less than 3 years on their 
sentence.
First of all, havent we learned yet that spiritual 
things belong in the hands of spiritual leaders? 1st 
Corinthians 2:14 says, But the natural man receiveth 
NOT the things of the Spirit of God: for they are 
foolishness unto him: NEITHER can he (the natural man) 
know them, because they are SPIRITUALLY discerned.
Second, my godson has a life sentence and after 3 
weeks of showing him the Bible and by being an example 
to him he has accepted Jesus as his Savior. Can we deny 
ANY man the opportunity to see and accept Jesus just 
because he has a sentence of more than 3 years?
PLEASE Sir, dont let this happen! Spiritual things 
belong in the hands of spiritual people.
God bless you.

Good Morning, Jeb,

It was a pleasure seeing you last week to hear your speech at the 22nd
annual TaxWatch meeting at the Ponte Vedra Inn.  You have done an excellent
job as Governor of our fine state.  I was especially interested in your
remarks about the 'Hot Mantra' of the time:  "Hire the Right People For the
Right Job'!

I am a Telecommunications Consultant who has learned that all organizations
face 2 kinds of problems:  Systems (whether telecom, data, utilities, etc.)
and People!  I have partnered with experts in all these arenas to be able to
solve these problems.  Undeniably, People problems are the first priority.

I have assessment tools that are used for pre-Hire and post-Hire that are
EEOC compliant and ADA and psychologist certified and validated as recently
as this year.  These tools give the organization the capability to correctly
Job Match and Career Path those high quality individuals you want to retain.
If employees are happy in their job and see the organization is interested
enough in them to develop a career strategy, they will perform at top
levels!

I have prepared a Power Point Slide Show for you to review showing
Department of Labor statistics and proven reduction of job turnover thus
improving the "Bottom Line"!

I have also set up your own sample assessment Website:  Please go to
www.profilesontheweb.com, click on Login.  User name is State of Florida and
password is 12345.  You will be able to see the full range of tests
available and sample reports to be used in coaching your staff.

Clare Rice (Consulting) and I would love the opportunity to present to the
appropriate department heads in charge of this initiative.  Who should I
call for an appointment?

I thank you for the opportunity to make a difference for the State of

Dear Governor Bush,
 
As you know I was appointed to the Working Group of the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task Force by your office through Allison DeFoor.  As such I was told that I represented your/Allisons office on the Working Group and reported directly to Allison.  In addition I also conducted a number of other tasks, including developing the Acceleration Plan for Phase 2, PSTA development, and other tasks as assigned.  I conducted all of these activities under the auspices of your/Allisons office and represented myself as such.  After Allison left I was left without a Task Force member to report to and thus represent no one on the Working Group.  This has put me in a very difficult position as no matter how hard I work on issues I do not have a senior person to report to.  I have been told that the Secretary of the Interior will be sending you a letter shortly asking for confirmation of your appointments to the Task Force.  I would greatly appreciate it if you could let me know who you will be appointing to take Allisons place and if you wish me to report to this person.  I feel that I can be of significant service to your office and wish to continue in my role on the Working Group, but without a Task Force member to report to this activity seems futile.  Although I currently serve as an advisory consultant to FDEP (Denver) it would not be appropriate for me to report to him as FDEP is represented on both the Task Force and Working Group already.
 
I know you have not requested my advice but, I would like to suggest to you that the office Allison held in your administration was very important and that without someone outside of FDEP looking at Everglades issues specifically, these matters are not being handled as effectively as before.  I would recommend that you reestablish this position as it would greatly assist in the coordination of Everglades restoration.
 
Thank you for your time and consideration.

Subject: Trauma Program at Westside Regional Medical Center


Dear Governor Bush:

	I am the Chief Executive Officer of Westside Regional Medical
Center.  I am writing to you regarding a matter that is of significant
importance and urgency to Westside and HCA, East Florida Division.  Westside
has filed its Letter of Intent to make application for a trauma center to be
located in its facility.  Westside is located in Plantation, West Broward
County, Florida.  There are currently three trauma centers in Broward
County, all of which are located at the I-95 boundary.  Although the
Department of Health rule allows for "a minimum of 4" trauma centers in
Broward, the Department has indicated that it intends to reject the
applications to establish a fourth trauma center.

	As you are aware, 55% of Broward residents live west of I-95.  As
you can imagine, in a trauma situation travel time can be a matter of life
and death.  I am personally aware of this critical issue.  My nephew's life
was in jeopardy while waiting one hour for transport to the trauma facility
in Dade County.  Unfortunately, Dade only has two trauma facilities.
Additionally, the transport issues involved from west to east Broward create
an unnecessary burden on the EMS and firefighters.  Our demographic data
indicates that 39% of the trauma cases in Broward County could be better
served by a facility west of I-95.  The Department's rejection of this
proposal unnecessarily weakens the medical service to these trauma victims.

	I understand that the public hospitals very carefully guard their
trauma business.  However, both the taxpayers of Broward County and the
citizens of the State of Florida underwrite that business.  It seems prudent
for the Department to permit the establishment of the fourth trauma center,
not only to serve those west Broward residents but also to alleviate the
financial burden on the county and state.  Westside/HCA would receive no
public funds to create this necessary trauma center.  Shareholders NOT
taxpayers would underwrite the costs associated.

	I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this matter with you and
your staff at your convenience.  I sincerely hope that we could have that
chance before the Department takes some action that closes the door to this
opportunity.

I spoke on the phone with Dr. Lestage, the vice president of BCBS.  He told me the contract gives him the discretion to allow my husband to have this procedure.  In fact, according to our patient advocate at MD Anderson at least seven Blue Cross Blue Shields around the country, including Federal BCBS have paid for this procedure.  Dr. Lestage promised me he would look into why the seven other adjusters permitted the procedure, but he clearly did not do this when he denied our third appeal. (He denied the appeal before he contacted the seven or so adjusters).

Dear Governor Bush:
The DOC has been vindictive because of what I have done to try to help.  It makes me physically ill. 

I called your attention, to a young incarcerated man -C. Elliott (Tomoka) who requested the Doctor's continuance of adult diapers -- because he was soiling himself.  He was embarrassed and afraid of going out on the compound because of the inability of control of his incontinence problem.  When I first learned of this young man's problem, he was emotionally stable and working very well in the educational department with one of my student.  All he was requesting was for his adult diapers to be continued.  He wrote a formal grievance to the DOC.  He also wrote a letter asking me for help in this problem.

Since my involvement he was restricted to the medical department-not allowed to communicate with his family--kept in medical confinement -- sent to Butler C I for temporary stay (with diapers), and then onto Lake C I into a Behavioral program...(without diapers)...because they his say incontinence is all in his head.  (Did they ever have a specialist review his back and spine injury?) His emotional well-being has been shattered.  The treatment he has received has obliterated his emotional stability. 

You know, it really shouldn't matter why a person is incontinent, if emotionally you need the security of adult diapers-you should have them. The American civil rights act under section 504, disability act, suggests that it is his right to have them.

The DOC has taken a young man with an incontinence problem and has emotionally abused him to the point of causing his mental health to disintegrate.  Would I tell you this if it wasn't true?

Is this what you were thinking should happen when you wanted the DOC to look into this?

This Christmas will not be a happy one for this young man and his mother.

They  finally are going to allow the people of Hardee County to have a public hearing. The hearing will be in Wauchula not at the SFCC in Highland Co.  Now the people of Hardee Co. can make a choice as to what "THEY WANT'.
My pain is eased and I know yours is also.
 
Two other suggestions.
1-At the bottom of the Florida Auto tag what about putting 
"WWW.MyFlorida.com.
2-There are state regulations on "HOW"schools are built, What about "WHERE" schools are built?

Subject: Teacher Professionalism/ELC



Dear Governor Bush,

I first want to welcome you as the Education Leaders Coucil's newest and
most prominent member.  I greatly appreciate your confidence in our work. We 
are very proud of what has been accomplished in Florida over the last three 
years and look forward to continuing to support your efforts to improve the 
quality of education for all of Florida's children.

I am writing to request a meeting with you, Lieutenant Governor Brogan and
Secretary Horne to discuss a promising new joint venture the Education
Leaders Council is forming to provide high quality, research driven teacher
professional development/certification courses in reading (for k-3 teachers)
and in using technology effectively to improve student achievement.  ELC is
moving aggressively to play a direct role in providing quality services to
our members that actually make a difference in improving student
achievement.

We strongly believe this is an important moment of opportunity to build on
successes like Florida's strong accountability system created by you and
Lieutenant Governor Brogan and the President's "No Child Left Behind" bill 
(please see attached - self-aggrandizing and hopefully thoroughly true - 
press release), passed earlier this week, which have created a "culture of 
achievement."  We believe that improving instructional quality is critical to 
maintaining and building on the momentum created by leading states and now at 
the federal level for serious accountability and a focus on results for 
children.

As you are aware, research consistently supports the premise that a quality
teacher is the most important element in determining success in any
instructional environment.  Unfortunately, however, our education schools
have largely failed us in preparing significant numbers of high quality
teachers and most professional development opportunities for teachers have
had very limited or no success in impacting the overall quality of public
school teaching.

We are creating a program that will change that dismal trend in teacher
professional development that can be delivered cost-effectively.  I would
very much like to meet with you, Lieutenant Governor Brogan and Sec. Horne 
along with Randy Best, Chairman of Voyager Expanded Learning, to discuss how 
ELC might serve your needs in this area.  If this is of interest to you, 
please let me know how best to follow up in arranging a meeting.


We are grateful for your leadership and for the leadership of your family.  
God bless you and yours this season.

SIncerely,

Lisa Keegan

The Governor wants to know the following:

How was cost and value of SOUTHCOM land and headquarters established?

On the $40 million purchase figure floating around Congress last year...how
did that number come about?

What is market value now?  How is this figure derived?

-----Original Message-----

Subject: Costs for SOUTHCOM HQ



Current lease costs.  Total for HQ property is $3.1 million per year.  Total
for additional space (office/warehouse) in the area, $1.2 million per year.

~ HQ Building.  Current lease expires Feb 2008.  Lease costs are
approximately $2 million per year.

~ Land.  Land for security buffer surrounding the HQ (19+ acres) is
currently has authorityto lease (through condemnation proceedings)
year-to-year through Feb 2008 for $1-$1.1 million per year.

~ State land.  Land from State to complete security buffer (15 acres) is $0
per year for 50 years.
to leased and land Purchase.

~ Additional neighboring leases.  Currently a patchwork of seven 2 - 5 year
leases to supplement HQ space at a cost of $1.2 million per year.  These
leases account for 30% of our total office space, and there is a small
amount for warehouse.  Ideally we would develop an Annex next the the
current HQ and eliminate these other leases.    

Purchase. 

~ The last time DoD considered pursuing authorization to purchase (last
year...for FY02 purchase) the cost was estimated to be $40 million.  

~ This would have purchased the HQ building and land.  A logical follow-on
would have been to develop the Annex structure at a cost of around $16
million.  

~ As an aside...truth in lending requires that I say, it is likely purchase
would require some type of court proceeding based on the experience with the
buffer land.  In the case of the buffer land the Corps of Engineers (they
are our agent for real estate issues) offered 125% of valuation for the land
lease but the owner countered at approximately 200% of value for best offer.
Thus the Corps had to execute a lease through condemnation (whereby the
courts ensure fair value compensation to the owner).

Dear Governor Bush,

I thank you for taking time to meet with us on 12/19/01.  Liberty has 
valued the opportunity to work closely with the Department of Children and 
Families to implement and manage the Jimmy Ryce program from its inception. 
 Liberty is the only private organization in the country that has 
successfully operated large-scale treatment programs for civilly committed 
sexual predators for state mental health authorities.  Liberty has 
established state-of-the-art programs for sexually violent predators for 
two of the biggest states in the country - Illinois and Florida.  We look 
forward to a continuing collaboration with the Department on this important 
project.

In addition, we have also been providing health services at Landmark 
Developmental Center for over 10 years.  As described in the literature we 
left with you, we are also the only private organization in the country 
that has extensive experience with right-sizing and/or closing state 
developmental centers.  Clearly, our model supports your plan for reducing 
the number of state employees.  In fact, we have already successfully 
transitioned state employees as part of our mission of providing health 
services at Landmark, and created employment opportunities at the Jimmy 
Ryce program for over 60 state employees of G. Pierce Wood Hospital during 
its current closure.

Not only can Liberty close the Landmark facility for the Department of 
Children and Families, we believe we can save money for the state during 
the closure, while successfully transitioning individuals with 
developmental disabilities into the community.

I appreciate your time and can assure you that we will continue our 
commitment to serving the unique program needs of these special populations 
in Florida.

Sincerely,

Herb Caskey, M.D.

Governor,
We have been trying to reach Ms. Adkins but she is out of town for the
holidays.  The Florida Association of Court Clerks is in touch with the
Employer who sent the check and is in the process of resolving this. 
They should have it completed shortly.
Let me know if you need anything else on this.
All the best for a joyous holiday season to you and your family.

ASAP
to see how they can expedite the payment you seek.

Subject: Problems collecting child support...help!


I have been without a child support payment since Sept 1 for my 3
children.  I waited the required 30 days before contacting my attorney
to get an income deduction order to have the child support payments
taken straight out of my former husbands salary.  It took another 6
weeks to get the order signed by a judge.  On November 30, 2001, I was
told by my former husband's employer that a check would be maild out
that day and be sent to the state depository.  That was 16 days ago
and
when I call the hotline number to check on the status of the payments,
they tell me that it has not been received or posted.  I now have to
wait another 7 business days so they can run a trace on the check to
see
where it went. 
This is RIDICULOUS!  I have 3 children that depend on the child
support
payments to eat, have clothing, shelter, school, and then some.  I was
wary about going through the state for collection of the child support
because this has happened to so many of my divorced friends.  As it
stands now, they will have no Christmas!  I have exhausted my savings
to
support them the last few months.  And to make matters worse, I have
to
go back to my attorney to get the back child support caught up along
with collecting the back medical bills I am owed for the last year!
That will cost me another $725.00 that I do not have! 
Any help in expediting my payment through the system will be greatly
appreciated.  My kids might be able to have a merry Christmas. 

Sincerely,

Dear Rodney,

The Hollywood Police Dept is proudly hosting this Conference in July
2002.  The site for the Conference is the brand new Diplomat Hotel on
Hollywood Beach and we are anticipating over 300 Police Chiefs from all
over the State to attend. In addition to the Chiefs and their families,
Senior staff members from Law Enforcement Agencies are also invited and
expected.  This is a four day Conference which will include Law
Enforcement equipment vendors, Training Seminars, and opportunities for
professional interaction and information sharing.

This Summer's Conference is also the 50th Anniversary of the Florida
Police Chief's Association and we are seeking a dynamic personality and
speaker for the Installation Dinner on Wednesday, July 03 (6:30 pm -
8:30pm).  With all that has happened this year in Law Enforcement, and
specific to our State, we would love to have Governor Bush honor us with
his attendance and address the attendees on July 03.  Is there anything
you can do to assist?  It would certainly be appreciated.

It's a small firm of 275 people.  He'll be one of three VPs.  They represent

They want a piece of the Everglades Restoration program.  They do some 404

Dear Kathy,
 
Found your phone message when we got back from court.  Thank you so much.  I have emailed my son in Bosnia that we are moving forward to get the clothes over to him.
 
Many friends are halping to box the clothing so that it can go into the shipping containers better than the bagged stuff.
 
We look forward to hearing more from you and USAID soon.
 
Point of fact, our closest AF Base is Eglin.  Second closest is Tyndall.  The closest Army Post is Ft. Rucker in Alabama and the Navy is at Pensacola.  Don't know if any of that is helpful.

Cyber Citizens For Justice Dispatch - Distribute Widely -

Dear members and friends, 
 
As you know, the State Tax Reform Task Force will complete its mandate and provide a final report to the Governor, President of the Senate and Speaker of the House by February 1, 2002.  
 
The 2nd draft of the task force proposed recommendations, an (8) eight page document, is available online and provided for your perusal. 


http://www.state.fl.us/edr/taxref/finalreportdraft2.pdf
 
If you detest attachments (as I do) let me know and we'll try to get the report to you in another way. We're sure to have the reports posted on our Website in the near future. Right Jan? 
 
BTW, you might recall our recent inquiry of Senator John McKay, President of the Senate, re tax reform proposals he decided to provide which seem to circumvent the mandate of the task force of which he's a member? 
 
Although we did not receive a response from his office we have found a copy of his (39) thirty nine pageTax Reform Proposals. 
 
Because of the difficulty encountered while downloading we've provided the home page of the Senator. From there you can access the report by clicking on the Tax Reform Proposal line. 
 
* SEE BELOW * 
 
WARNING: The .pdf format utilized to prepare this document, with all the colorful pages, icons, pictures, Senate Seal, etc., is very time consuming to download. Maybe it's my AA software?
 
It took approximately (16) sixteen minutes for the first two pages to download. Let me know if you have better luck. Thank you.  
 
Internally, the report has dark blue backround pages that aren't weren't user friendly. We contacted his office and requested a review and/or revision and a preparation in .html format. 
 
Anyhow! 
 
It's interesting to compare these reports to learn how State Tax Reform might affect the Citizens of Florida. Several bills have been prefiled that intend to deal with this issue during the 2002 Legislative session but it's doubtful anything significant will happen because the Legislators are going to be quite busy 'carving up the state' for political gain.  
 
However, 'Skeletons,' as in, 'bare bones' do exist for tax reform as is the case for the possibility of deregulating the electrical industry. 
So, Stay Tuned! 
   
Good luck with the McKay report!  
 
Your comments and suggestions are always appreciated. Thank you. 
 
The best to you and yours,

Subject: CONFIDENTIAL: Prospect follow up



Regarding the prospect you called me about this morning: 

After researching the company and recent history in Florida, I called the 
contact the CEO gave you. We had a brief conversation before he had to 
leave, but he will get back to me this evening or tomorrow. I also left a 
message for Stu Turley, to let him know you had followed up and see what 
else he could tell me.  

Here's a stroke of luck that we may, if we get the chance, use at the right 
time:  Manny Fernandez (Gartner, UF Trustee) is on the prospects Board, 
their executive committee, and chairs their "Corporate Governance" 
committee. 

Regarding the permitting issues, I spent considerable time getting briefed 
by their local attorneys, Wade Hopping and Gary Hunter. I asked Gary to 
provide me with a written summary of their issues which will probably be 
more accurate than my retelling of the story.  Hopefully, the client will 
allow this, and you can use it to assess the situation.  This is one side of 
the story, and I am sure DEP has a different perspective. 

The permitting problem that I was aware of when you called me had to do with 
the company not getting air permits before they began an expansion about 2 
years ago. They were under the impression that their existing permits would 
be sufficient.  That situation was corrected.  [FYI: this is a "Title V" air 
emission facility....fiberglass emissions are a bit nasty.] 

More recently they have had problems with manatees and US Fish and Wildlife 
and local manatee clubs.  I am told the company has asked for help from your 
office to get US F & W  to respect Florida rules (speed) within the barge 
canal.  This issue has been very difficult for them, and remains a problem. 

But they are really unhappy about the "raid" you mentioned.  And if their 
lawyers account is reasonably accurate, they have every reason to be. 
Apparently a busload of DEP law enforcement officers, complete with flack 
jackets and guns, with press there to witness, descended upon one of their 
plants in response to a caller who alleged they were dumping hazardous 
waste.  DEP reps apparently mentioned to the press, and they reported, that 
this was a "criminal investigation" involving "suspected felonies".  That 
was in February, '01.  My understanding is that prior to the "raid", when 
the company first heard about the allegations, they did their own testing 
(after informing DEP in case they wanted to witness) and found nothing.  And 
apparently DEP didn't either.  The company feels their reputation was 
needlessly damaged and that the whole thing was mishandled.  

So, we have a lot to overcome to convince the CEO to invest more in Florida.

Frank,
 
Some of this depends on the actual costs of the elections equipment that each county is now puchasing, but it looks like we will be eligible for the following if the Senate accepts the Ney-Hoyer Bill:
 
Replacement of punch-card voting systems:            $21,528,000
Election Fund Payments                                       $132,740,000
for such things as DB management,
voter registration efforts,
Election tabulation equip,
Pollworker training,
and voter education.
 
Like I said, if this passes we are in line for a lot of money.
 
Thanks,
 
Clay

We will be elligible for $6,000 per precinct for each precinct which used punch cards in 2000.  I am working up numbers for that.  That would provide some relief on the voter systems money that will be appropriated next year.  Additionally, there is money for voter education and pollworker training that would provide some relief to us.  I will forward better numbers soon.

Nina, 
The House approved election reform legislation last night by a vote of 362-63. The Help America Vote Act of 2001 (H.R. 3295) authorizes funding to states and counties to replace and update voting systems, and establishes mandatory election standards for states.
Federal standards under the bill would require that states do the following: 
o        Implement a statewide voter registration system linked to local jurisdictions; 
o        Permit provisional voting, or an alternative that achieves the same objective, in all precincts; 
o        Maintain and update voter registration records; 
o        Adopt uniform vote tabulation standards; 
o        Tabulate all military and overseas ballots; and 
o        Provide new voting systems for voters with disabilities. 
These standards are not optional and would apply whether or not a state received federal funding. 
Funds authorized under the bill include a one-time payment or reimbursement to states and counties of approximately $400 million to replace existing punch card voting equipment and a $2.25 billion "Election Fund" to provide payments to states over three years. States would be required to provide a 25 percent matching payment before receiving monies from the fund. The Election Fund would be administered by a bipartisan "Election Assistance Commission" comprised of state and local election officials, election experts, and other interested parties.
The Senate has not yet approved election reform legislation and is continuing with internal negotiations to develop a compromise, bipartisan reform package.

The 131 page Final Report is available online. It is a MUST READ!
 
****************************************************
"The Study Commission recommends a comprehensive framework for the industry that is sensitive to consumers and all other stakeholders. The commission's vision for the next 20 years is; 
 
Florida's supply and use of energy promotes economic prosperity, limits environmental impacts and enhances the quality of life of Floridians." 
 
In it's conclusion the commission opines further; 
 
"The recommendations in this report will bring about competition in Florida's wholesale market without the problems encountered in California. The recommendations can be expected to result in adequate reliable suppokes of electricity, price stability and reasonable costs."

How we get 'from here to there' might be found in the 131 page Final Report of the study commission? Adobe Acrobate software required. If you have a problem let us know.

Incidentally, the pursuit of commission goals will surely be found in the current language of prefiled bills and, once included, in the 'skeleton' bills prefiled in time for the 2002 Legislative session. Stay tuned!  
 
Thanks for your interest. We look forward to your comments and suggestions.

Thanks for the support, Frank! Liza has been so diligent in her efforts for First Serve and we really appreciate it. The site summary will be finished today and emailed to you. We're also preparing a proposal to the Fl Dept of Education, as instructed by Liza. 


 Last week we had a very exciting meeting at Gaines Park, one of the 13 sites, in Palm Beach. The Campus Manager of the park, Reed Daniel, invited a friend, Joe Gallucci, of the Millrose Athletic Associatio. Well, Joe loved the First Serve initiative goals and pretty much committed to giving us $20,000 - $25,000 from his association for the Gaines Park site. He may get involved on a larger scale later. Things are really starting to happen and the communities are geared up to start their programs Jan-Feb of 2002. 


I leave for CA on Christmas day and return on New Year's Eve. I drive to Palm Beach tomorrow to help that group with their grant application. The First Serve grant apps. are out to the sites and due back to me by Jan. 11th. If you need to reach me tomorrow, try my cell 941-350-5079. 


Happy Holidays,

As planned,  I have worked with DMS and contacted all the rest of the state
agencies from whom I had not yet requested water use and conservation
reporting, and we have combined such reporting with the DMS energy tracking
project as they had included water in their reporting form.

Although DMS is only requiring the energy report annually, after
consultation
with you, Frank, I have asked for the water use and conservation report
twice
a year, with the heads up that we might need more often during serious
drought times.  The water reports will be due on February 15 and on August
15, which is DMS's annual due date.

I hope to get an interim report to you soon on agencies that have been
reporting then should have a more comprehensive report after February.

The governor's letter on the energy reporting mentioned bringing in energy
efficiency experts to help conduct an efficiency review and make energy
savings recommendations.  I do not know where funding would come from or who
would be the project manager for such an effort, but should we consider the
same thing for water use?

An agreement was reached on a bi-partisan basis for House passage of the economic stimulus package.  The Administration has 5 Senate Democrats but need another 5 to hit the magic 60 cloture vote.which several Senate Democrats say will never happen.so this bill could still die.
 
Nonetheless attached is a summarythe key issues we were focused on were the 30% depreciation (could cost Fl $200M), some form of offset to the depreciation cost and TANF Supplemental Grants.  The compromise includes the depreciation allowance for 3 years; the offset is labeled Temporary State Health Care Assistance and after discussions with the team, the state can use the one time, $164,619,369 in general revenue; and TANF Supp is included (+$60M).  Also included are the National Emergency Grants.
 
NGA gave us lots of credit today on getting the Administration to move to some form of rational balance.  I honestly believe that our meetings yesterday with Chairman Thomas staff, WH, OMB and everyone else in the hallway that would listen to KS, and our continuous calls to the Hill, made a big difference!
 
Ive been waiting all day to hear from Chairman Youngs staff on seaport security.  At 7 pm tonight he was still in final drafting stages and was unavailable.  We will try to reach him first thing in the a.m.  
 
We will work to get a weekly report out before we leave tomorrow and will hopefully have more details by then.

Subject:	GOVERNORS ONLY: Economic Stimulus Conference Call Today at 1:00	EST

We will be hosting a conference call today at 1:00 EST to update you on the
progress of the economic stimulus package.
Mark Weinberger, Assistant Secretary for Tax at Treasury, and Mark McClellan
from the President's Council of Economic Advisors will be on the call.

I spoke with a number of you last night, and as we discussed, the latest House
version is very good for states (or at least as good as it can get at the
moment) -- it includes $4.6 billion in "Temporary State Health Care Assistance"
-- a one time distribution to states to help meet health care costs -- and the
best thing about this is that as soon as the President signs the bill, states
would immediately receive this money.

I will shortly send out a state by state breakdown of this money.

The latest House version also includes $9 billion in accelerated Reed Act
distributions for states and $4 billion in National Emergency Grants.

The House version, passed last night, is essentially what was agreed to by the
President and Senate centrists yesterday.

If states and Governors need economic relief, this economic stimulus package is
the only way to go.  The House has acted, the President has agreed, and now we
need the Senate to act immediately.

THE CALL IN INFORMATION IS AS FOLLOWS:

NUMBER:   800-659-6183
PASSWORD: Economic

Please confirm your parcipation with Keith Brancato at 202-456-2896.

Dear Governor Bush,

I guess whats done is done and I need to begin thinking about how to
keep my
company going. What I said in my email yesterday was the truth, I have
lost
a lot of investment money over the past few weeks, and due to the code
being
delayed, will not take in much needed revenue. My email yesterday was a
bit
harsh and I apologize for that, but when something you work so hard for
gets
put in jeopardy, and the employees I care so much about have to be laid
off
right before Christmas, it is something that makes me somewhat
emotional,
which I hope you can understand.

Though somewhat sarcastic, my comments about finacial assistance from
the
government is also very serious. I ask you please to find some way for
us to
secure some sort of SBA or another type of government financing as soon
as
possible. I know these programs are available, and ask you please find
someway to fast track something so we can stay in business.

Myself and all my employees have worked incredibly hard to prepare for
these
codes and truly have the potential to create hundreds of jobs throughout
Florida, but I need your help, Please!!!

Subject: Update from the Governor's Longhorn Committee
Importance: High


Governor,

Here is a quick update from our first day in Texas:

First of all, we have some ideas on infrastructure that we would like to
discuss with you in person.  Are you available Friday the 21st?

Preliminary game plan:
1.  Must agree and adopt research that underpins initiative.  We
envision
bringing an expert/technical group together to re-confirm Florida's
basic
research foundation already in place.  Every single part of this
initiative
must be aligned with this research, and now that HR 1 has passed
Congress,
we can move forward.

2.  We need to tie the 4th grade social promotion issue to your reading
initiatve goal that every child must be reading on grade level by the
end of
3rd grade (we can change legislation to 3rd grade now that we have 3rd
grade
FCAT testing.) This involves legislative buy-in and policy makers
establishing target dates and percentage of students who must achieve
this
goal (not this year).

3. The Florida Board of Education needs to require all Colleges of
Education
to align all reading teacher prep programs to the research-based
curriculum
of Just Read, Florida!

4.  The Commissioner or Secretary needs to issue a "List of Approved
Early
Diagnostic Reading Instruments" (K-3).  This list should include the two
that DOE already provides to districts at no cost, as well as the Texas
version (which they have offered to us at a competitive price.)  The
second
piece to this is that we need to immediately train teachers/principals
on
how to use this assessment data to inform diagnosis and classroom
instructionh.  We are investigating how much of the new federal money
can be
used for this training.

5.  The number one recommendation from Texas is that we train Leadership
before classroom teachers.  We have the infrastructure in place to
utilize
our Area Centers for Educational Enhancement (ACEE's) for training.  But
we
need to revamp and revitalize them ( we have a plan -- which is part of
our
face to face discussion.)  We want to recognize principals who complete
this
training -- one way to do that would be to require that in order for a
school to get Reading First money (the federal dollars) the principal
must
complete this training.

For any/all of the above to work, we have to adopt the philosophy that
the
best way to attack the crisis in reading is to come out guns slinging,
taking no prisoners, and letting people know that our plan is
non-negotiable.

Tomorrow we are meeting with Reed Lyon, and will have much more to
offer.

If you need to talk to us about any of the above, we can be reached at
Cheryl's cell phone 591-3311.  We don't know if you have to use the area
code or not....

Bye for now from your special ops forces in Texas,
Mary Laura, Cheryl, and Don

 

This is from our first day here.  Tomorrow we are meeting with Reed
Lyon,
and will have more to share.

Governor:

I'm just reviewing the latest growth management bill. Would you be willing
to answer a few questions from me on growth management?:

Are you going to be pushing for something on growth management to pass in
the next session, or is it going to be too hard with redistricting on the
table?

What are your top priorities for the growth management legislation?

Governor Bush,
     Thank you for the Tony Cooper appointment to the Port Authority.  We
were all very happy with your selection.
     Thank you also for signing the book which Rose Ferlita (Tampa City
Councilwoman and my new boss) asked you to sign for my Christmas present.
 It was a surprise when Kimberly Dale delivered it today and it was to me
from you and Rose.  My most special gift.  Thank you sir.  I was
extremely touched.
     Have a wonderful Christmas.

Governor Bush, I understand you raised a question about he purchase of land by IFAS at Apopka. This represents a major consolidation. We closed Leesburg and Sanford facilities, both will now be used by the counties.
We gave up 366 acres and added 70 at Apopka.
We will be much more efficent and effective as a result of this change

FYI Several staff and faculty members in my department have stopped me in 
the hall today to express their outrage over Senator McKay's comments in the 
Gainesville Sun encouraging folks to take their shotguns into IFAS on a 
Friday after 4PM..  

1.  They resent the implication that IFAS folks do not work hard for their 
paychecks (and they are not aware that the Senator ever visited our building 
before making such a remark). 
2.  They feel that if any of them had made similar comments about the 
Florida Senate, that they would have been slammed into jail for threatening 
public officials carrying out their duties in a public building.  They want 
to know how anyone can get away with making such comments, especially in the 
wake of September 11th. 
3.  Several of the women who work on the first floor in my building  have 
said they now feel unsafe -- from crazies who might "take the hint" from 
McKay; I would not be surprized if some of my employees do take off this 
Friday and go home before 4PM. 

In the best of times, folks would be worried about losing their jobs; in 
these times of terrorism and other acts of public violence, this was an 
especially insensitive remark for a leading public official to make. 

Folks in my department have been pretty calm and fearless about all this 
budget-cut stuff -- they're pulling together, willing to endure the 
belt-tightening for the sake of the IFAS team, etc. (Several have inquired 
about the possibility of voluntary furloughs or going part time to prevent 
others from losing their jobs, etc.) But this latest cavalier comment from a 
key Florida legislator has REALLY ticked them off and contributed to a 
marked decline in morale. 

I know my staff and faculty are not alone in their feelings about this 
issue.  I assume other personnel in other departments are equally outraged.

Subject: Update from the Governor's Longhorn Committee
Importance: High


Governor,

Here is a quick update from our first day in Texas:

First of all, we have some ideas on infrastructure that we would like to
discuss with you in person.  Are you available Friday the 21st?

Preliminary game plan:
1.  Must agree and adopt research that underpins initiative.  We envision
bringing an expert/technical group together to re-confirm Florida's basic
research foundation already in place.  Every single part of this initiative
must be aligned with this research, and now that HR 1 has passed Congress,
we can move forward.

2.  We need to tie the 4th grade social promotion issue to your reading
initiatve goal that every child must be reading on grade level by the end of
3rd grade (we can change legislation to 3rd grade now that we have 3rd grade
FCAT testing.) This involves legislative buy-in and policy makers
establishing target dates and percentage of students who must achieve this
goal (not this year).

3. The Florida Board of Education needs to require all Colleges of Education
to align all reading teacher prep programs to the research-based curriculum
of Just Read, Florida!

4.  The Commissioner or Secretary needs to issue a "List of Approved Early
Diagnostic Reading Instruments" (K-3).  This list should include the two
that DOE already provides to districts at no cost, as well as the Texas
version (which they have offered to us at a competitive price.)  The second
piece to this is that we need to immediately train teachers/principals on
how to use this assessment data to inform diagnosis and classroom
instructionh.  We are investigating how much of the new federal money can be
used for this training.

5.  The number one recommendation from Texas is that we train Leadership
before classroom teachers.  We have the infrastructure in place to utilize
our Area Centers for Educational Enhancement (ACEE's) for training.  But we
need to revamp and revitalize them ( we have a plan -- which is part of our
face to face discussion.)  We want to recognize principals who complete this
training -- one way to do that would be to require that in order for a
school to get Reading First money (the federal dollars) the principal must
complete this training.

For any/all of the above to work, we have to adopt the philosophy that the
best way to attack the crisis in reading is to come out guns slinging,
taking no prisoners, and letting people know that our plan is
non-negotiable.

Tomorrow we are meeting with Reed Lyon, and will have much more to offer.

If you need to talk to us about any of the above, we can be reached at
Cheryl's cell phone 591-3311.  We don't know if you have to use the area
code or not....

Bye for now from your special ops forces in Texas,
Mary Laura, Cheryl, and Don

 

This is from our first day here.  Tomorrow we are meeting with Reed Lyon,
and will have more to share.

Dear Governor Bush,
Gulf County REALLY needs your help, if St. Joe Company ends up with the mill site there will be no port. We would like to create decent paying jobs as well as income to the county itself, not the minimum wage jobs that will be created by SJC's plans. The state has sent a great deal of grant money to the Port Authority here that will all be for not if they are not able to purchase the mill site. You are our only hope, we need you to stand up for Gulf county and it's people, Gulf county does not need to be that dependant upon a company that has already thrown them into economic disaster once.
Thank you,
James and Karen Lawrence

Dear Tim:
Just returned from a meeting with the staff of the Department of Health in
Tallahassee and gained a comprehensive overview about the Emergency
Preparedness and Disaster Response activities.
I am very impressed and I suggested that all such activities should be
conveyed to the public as part of the Public Awareness campaign. Also
submitted to Dr. Agwunobi my proposal for an  Emergency Preparedness and
Disaster Response Manual called the " Family Defense Manual".
It is modeled after the Israeli experience with such a public awareness
education campaign prior and during the Gulf War.
I can have the book ready within 30 days and will continue to discuss the
funding strategy of such a project.
It should be made available to every resident in Florida for a self-cost
price.
Furthermore I want to inform you that I was invited by the American Jewish
Congress Commission on Law & Social Action to discuss "National Security and
Civil Liberty" on January 7, 2002 at the Finkelstein Auditorium- Nova
Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale. I will discuss the topic with
Prof. Johnny Burris, Assistant Professor of Law. I will attempt to present
the different challenges that our state and judicial system is facing to
fight terrorism and obviously will take the Pro and Dr. Burris the Contra
argument.
Will keep you posted.

     I have been out of town the last couple of days. I was informed that
you had signed the delay of the Building Code on Monday. I really appreciate
you signing the Bill.  I have had several meaningful conversation  with
Brian in your office concerning Growth Management and some new ideas how
FHBA can work better with your staff. I am sure that Brian has updated you
on our progress. Our goal is to have a Growth Management Billl that we all
can agree on before session starts and can work together to pass. Happy
Holidays to you and your family.

An agreement was reached on a bi-partisan basis for House passage of the economic stimulus package.  The Administration has 5 Senate Democrats but need another 5 to hit the magic 60 cloture vote.which several Senate Democrats say will never happen.so this bill could still die.
 
Nonetheless attached is a summarythe key issues we were focused on were the 30% depreciation (could cost Fl $200M), some form of offset to the depreciation cost and TANF Supplemental Grants.  The compromise includes the depreciation allowance for 3 years; the offset is labeled Temporary State Health Care Assistance and after discussions with the team, the state can use the one time, $164,619,369 in general revenue; and TANF Supp is included (+$60M).  Also included are the National Emergency Grants.
 
NGA gave us lots of credit today on getting the Administration to move to some form of rational balance.  I honestly believe that our meetings yesterday with Chairman Thomas staff, WH, OMB and everyone else in the hallway that would listen to KS, and our continuous calls to the Hill, made a big difference!
 
Ive been waiting all day to hear from Chairman Youngs staff on seaport security.  At 7 pm tonight he was still in final drafting stages and was unavailable.  We will try to reach him first thing in the a.m.  
 
We will work to get a weekly report out before we leave tomorrow and will hopefully have more details by then.

*	Although Floridas job market is experiencing the effects of a national recession, the November jobless rate of 5.0% can still be described as moderately low based on historical trends. It compares very favorably with the national rate which rose by .03% in November to 5.7%.

 

*	Of the six largest Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) in Florida, Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater continued to experience the fastest growth rate and created the most new jobs over the year (+40,300 jobs, +3.3 percent). The Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater area also leads the nation in job growth, with three other Florida MSAs making the top ten job growth list West Palm Beach-Boca Raton (3), Orlando (4), and Jacksonville (10).

  Critics of Affirmative Action Try to Head Off Texas A&M's New
  Admissions Policy

  By JEFFREY SELINGO
  
  
  
  Several leading opponents of affirmative action, including
  Ward Connerly and Linda Chavez, urged officials in Texas and
  at the U.S. Department of Education on Tuesday to derail a
  plan by Texas A&M University to automatically admit the top 20
  percent of students from 250 low-performing high schools in
  the state.
  
  Their request, which was made in two separate letters, will
  probably heighten interest in a policy passed in relative
  obscurity by the Texas A&M system's Board of Regents this
  month. Mr. Connerly is a University of California regent who
  successfully led campaigns in California and Washington state
  to ban affirmative action. Ms. Chavez, who withdrew under fire
  as President Bush's nominee to be labor secretary this year,
  is president of the Center for Equal Opportunity, an advocacy
  group that opposes the use of racial preferences.
  
  In one letter, the Center for Equal Opportunity and the
  American Civil Rights Institute, which Mr. Connerly leads,
  asked the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights to
  investigate whether the policy is unconstitutional and
  violates a federal-court decision banning affirmative action
  in admissions in Texas.
  
  In the other letter -- signed by Mr. Connerly, Ms. Chavez, and
  five others -- the group urged the attorney general of Texas,
  John Cornyn, to declare the policy illegal. Mr. Cornyn is
  reviewing the policy, at the request of Texas A&M.
  
  "The intent of the regents is clear," Mr. Connerly and others
  wrote in their letter to the attorney general. "In order to
  increase the number of freshmen to A&M belonging to some
  racial and ethnic minorities, the admission criteria will be
  different for those races and ethnicities."
  
  The group wrote that the policy's real purpose was to
  "circumvent" a 1996 federal-court decision known as Hopwood v.
  Texas, a case in which the state finally abandoned its appeals
  of this year. If the attorney general approved the policy, it
  would surely be challenged in court, the group wrote. "The
  state -- and your office in particular -- now has the chance
  to redeem itself after its shameful defense of racial and
  ethnic discrimination, or it can compound the error and its
  moral and economic costs."
  
  Texas already guarantees spots to the top 10 percent of
  graduates from the state's high schools under a 1997 law
  enacted to increase the number of minority students in the
  wake of Hopwood. The law was crafted to take advantage of some
  high schools' being predominantly black or Hispanic, but the
  law also benefits students at high schools where most students
  are white. The Texas A&M plan would extend that offer to the
  top 20 percent of the selected 250 high schools, as long as
  those students meet the university's minimum admissions
  standards for courses and test scores. Students automatically
  admitted in the top 10 percent don't have to meet those
  standards.
  
  Texas A&M officials refused to comment on the two letters on
  Tuesday. They have maintained that their 20-percent plan is an
  effort to increase the number of applicants from high schools
  that typically send few students to the institution, not to
  increase the number of minority students. They have yet to
  release a list of the high schools selected for the program,
  but said that the schools were identified without taking race
  into account, using instead factors such as high dropout rates
  and limited English proficiency.
  
  But Roger Clegg, general counsel at the Center for Equal
  Opportunity, said on Tuesday that a low-performing school was
  nothing more than another name for a predominantly minority
  high school. If Texas A&M was truly interested in admitting
  the most academically talented students, he said, it would not
  be focusing on high schools with low passage rates on
  statewide achievement tests.
  
  "What schools should be doing is figuring out what admissions
  criteria would best select the most academically qualified
  students and then let the chips fall where they may," Mr.
  Clegg said. "They should not be choosing admissions criteria
  because they would favor or disfavor a particular group."

  Dear General Cornyn:
  
  
  
  We write to express our grave concerns about a new admissions
  proposalthat was recently approved by the regents of Texas A &
  M University. Asyou may know, the regents have conditionally
  approved, pending anopinion from your office, a plan to target
  the graduates ofapproximately 250 low-performing Texas high
  schools for preferentialadmissions to their undergraduate
  program. Instead of just admitting thetop 10 percent of high
  school graduates from all schools throughout thestate, the
  regents propose to admit the top 20 percent from
  selectedschools.
  
  
  
  Based upon the comments of the A & M regents, the minutes of
  theirmeetings, and other evidence, it is our opinion that this
  is an effortto circumvent Hopwood v. Texas, 78 F.3d 932, cert.
  denied, 518 U.S. 1033 (1996).  That is, the high schools are
  being chosen because of theirracial and ethnic make-up, in an
  effort to favor some groups anddisfavor others in the
  admissions process at Texas A & M. Further, theoutcome of the
  implementation of this proposal will be to
  purposefullydiscriminate against individuals because of their
  race and ethnicity.This violates Titles VI of the Civil Rights
  Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C.2000d, and of the course the Equal
  Protection Clause of the FourteenthAmendment to the U.S.
  Constitution.
  
  
  
  We strongly urge you to deny the regents the ability to
  discriminateagainst individuals because of their race or
  ethnicity.
  
  
  
  
  
  If the tables were turned, and a Texas university were
  deliberatelytargeting high schools for recruitment that did
  not have very many blackor Latino students in order to limit
  their numbers, I doubt that therewould be much question about
  the practice's illegality. For example, ifthe regents of the
  University of Houston wanted to increase the numberof white
  students on their campus, would they be allowed to
  targetwealthy suburban high schools and offer admission to the
  top 20 percentof their graduates? The answer, of course, is
  that they would not.
  
  
  
  The intent of the regents is clear: in order to increase the
  number offreshmen to A & M belonging to some racial and ethnic
  minorities, theadmission criteria will be different for those
  races and ethnicities.
  
  
  
  This discrimination will surely be challenged in the courts
  next year ifit is allowed to proceed. The costs will be borne
  by the citizens whohave already paid millions for the Hopwood
  case.  The state -- and youroffice in particular -- now has a
  chance to redeem itself after itsshameful defense of racial
  and ethnic discrimination, or it can compoundthe error and its
  moral and economic costs.
  
  
  
  We encourage you to tell Texas A & M that its proposed new
  policy isillegal.

    Dec. 18, 2001
  
  
  
  
  
  Dear Mr. Jones:
  
  
  
  We are writing to apprise you of a looming civil rights
  violation atTexas A & M University and to ask you to
  investigate.
  
  
  
  The board of regents at A & M has recently approved a new
  admissionsplan that we believe is designed to discriminate
  against students basedupon their race and ethnicity. The new
  plan will grant a preference tostudents from predominately
  minority high schools over all otherstudents by granting
  automatic admission to students from the top 20percent of the
  graduating classes from those schools. Other studentsfrom
  primarily non-minority schools will automatically be admitted
  to A& M only if they graduate in the top 10 percent of their
  class.
  
  
  
  Based upon the general comments of the A & M regents and
  members of theadministration, the minutes of their meetings,
  and other evidence, it isour opinion that this is an effort to
  circumvent Hopwood v. Texas, 78F.3d 932, cert. denied, 518
  U.S. 1033 (1996).  That is, the high schoolsare being chosen
  because of their racial and ethnic make-up, in aneffort to
  favor some groups and disfavor others in the admissionsprocess
  at Texas A & M. The outcome of the implementation of
  thisproposal will be to purposefully discriminate against
  individualsbecause of their race and ethnicity. This violates
  Titles VI of theCivil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000d, and
  of the course the EqualProtection Clause of the Fourteenth
  Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
  
  
  
  It is apparent to us that if the tables were turned, and a
  Texasuniversity was deliberately targeting high schools for
  recruitment thatdid not have very many black or Latino
  students in order to limit theirnumbers, there would be little
  question about the practice's illegality.For example, if the
  regents of the University of Houston wanted toincrease the
  number of white students to their campus, would they beallowed
  to target wealthy suburban high schools and offer admission
  tothe top 20 percent of their graduates? The answer, of
  course, is thatthey would not.
  
  
  
  The circumstances of the adoption of this policy raise a
  stronginference that its aim is to favor certain students from
  specific racialand ethnic groups and disfavor others.  And, in
  light of the Hopwooddecision, which is the controlling
  precedent in Texas, there is no doubtthat such discrimination
  violates Title VI and the Equal ProtectionClause. We formally
  ask that you investigate this new policy.
  
  
  
  
  
  Very sincerely yours,

Subject: Is Florida too dependent on Tourism?


Governor Bush -

The predominant question today is: are we too dependent on Tourism as a
state?

I think that I have a great opportunity for you to start proving or further
prove this assumption wrong.  I'd like to invite you to utilize our new 96K
S.F., 150+ million dollar CyberCenter as a "media/photo-op" back-drop to
directly discuss Florida's ever-diversifying economy.

Please consider the following as a sample press release... we'd love to take
you and the media on a guided-tour of our new and still expanding
ultra-high-tech facility.  Outside of NASA, the CyberCenter is the #1
facility in the state in terms of "cutting edge" technology, and it
dramatically offers a preview into what will undoubtedly emerge as the
driving market segment of Florida's 21st century economy - the Internet and
Data Services.  With data services access speeds of up to OC-192, the
CyberCenter is literally leading the way for Florida's growth at "light
speed"...

Take a look at the political angle I have tried to craft for The Governor's
Office benefit in the below sample.  If interested, we'd love to work with
your staff to make such a speech/tour/media event available to your
schedule.  It seems to me that the timing would be perfect given the growing
concerns about the travel industry slump.  And I'd like to think that it
would be a help to your reelection efforts as well...

Take care - Kevin

The Qwest CyberCenter - Tampa, Florida

Florida's 21st century economy is far more diverse than most outsiders might
consider.  Tourism will always play a key role in Florida's future, but
Florida's business infrastructure is already one of the most diverse and
far-reaching economic models to be found anywhere - globally.  At the
"cutting edge" of this business expansion, Florida's cyber-economy has leapt
forward at a tremendous pace.

Whether you are a dot-com company looking to quickly build an online
business or an established enterprise interested in building or expanding an
Internet presence, Florida has already undergone the necessary conversions
to rank it as one of the leading Internet Backbone and Web Hosting locations
worldwide.  The new Qwest CyberCenter in Tampa, Florida stands as the
perfect example of this leading edge diversification of Florida's economy.
This new and still expanding state-of-the-art facility is Florida's largest
and most advanced Dedicated Hosting Center and one of only 16 such Qwest
CyberCenters nationwide.  This 96,000 square foot, 150-plus million dollar
facility is poised and ready to keep Florida among the top hosting locations
worldwide.

The Tampa Qwest CyberCenter provides a full range of hosting services and a
robust Information Technology environment, which will enable the full
spectrum of Florida businesses to outsource their Internet infrastructure.
The CyberCenter is a single-source Internet solutions provider, offering the
most comprehensive array of hosting services available in the industry.   It
features monitoring and management of web servers and mission-critical
applications 24/7.  The CyberCenter is rated to withstand a Class 5
hurricane and is equipped with redundant HVAC, fire detection and
suppression systems, power and LAN architecture.

Whether running multimedia, corporate intranet/extranet or e-commerce
applications, the Tampa Qwest CyberCenter provides a secure, reliable and
scalable foundation for the success of Florida businesses. Specifically
designed to provide state-of-the-art hosting for mission-critical Web sites
and enterprise applications, the Qwest CyberCenter provides a compelling
alternative to developing, deploying and staffing your own Internet data
center.

Qwest CyberCenters are staffed 24/7 and like Florida itself, we are always
open to new business.  From the history and charm of St. Augustine to the
futuristic advancements evidenced by the new Qwest CyberCenter in Tampa, the
state of Florida is uniquely positioned to span the centuries of American
history... past, present and yet to come.  The Qwest CyberCenter is a
shining example of the new Florida - a Florida poised and ready to champion
the economic growth of America's new millennium.  We welcome the opportunity
to share this new technology with the Governor of Florida via a personal
tour.  We welcome this opportunity to help the Governor's Office taut the
work of its ITFlorida Task Force.

Qwest strongly believes that the new Tampa CyberCenter represents the best
example of Florida's emergence as a worldwide center for high technology and
e-commerce.  Florida has already emerged as a crossroads for global commerce
and as a business development magnet for America's economic growth.  Qwest
is proud to support the Governor's initiatives in the areas of Information
Services and Technological Development.  Florida will continue to lead in
the area of Information Technology.  The Qwest CyberCenter is just one
example of the growth and expansion of this key sector of Florida's economy.

You meet with your Council of Economic Advisors tomorrow at 12:30 at the Economic Summit.  As you know, the Economic Summit is required under law before year end.  Per discussions had earlier this month, we opted to bring together Council of Econ Advisors, available Council of 100 task force members (only two coming), and relevant econ/business leaders together at Economic Summit.
 
See bottom of the agenda for list of those that are invited to the table.  Those listed on the right hand side are the Council of Economic Advisors (9 in total).  The Council of Economic Advisors are the lead group for discussions.  Others are there as resources for you.

Subject: Problems collecting child support...help!


I have been without a child support payment since Sept 1 for my 3
children.  I waited the required 30 days before contacting my attorney
to get an income deduction order to have the child support payments
taken straight out of my former husbands salary.  It took another 6
weeks to get the order signed by a judge.  On November 30, 2001, I was
told by my former husband's employer that a check would be maild out
that day and be sent to the state depository.  That was 16 days ago
and
when I call the hotline number to check on the status of the payments,
they tell me that it has not been received or posted.  I now have to
wait another 7 business days so they can run a trace on the check to
see
where it went. 
This is RIDICULOUS!  I have 3 children that depend on the child
support
payments to eat, have clothing, shelter, school, and then some.  I was
wary about going through the state for collection of the child support
because this has happened to so many of my divorced friends.  As it
stands now, they will have no Christmas!  I have exhausted my savings
to
support them the last few months.  And to make matters worse, I have
to
go back to my attorney to get the back child support caught up along
with collecting the back medical bills I am owed for the last year!
That will cost me another $725.00 that I do not have! 
Any help in expediting my payment through the system will be greatly
appreciated.  My kids might be able to have a merry Christmas.

I understand you have signed the bill that will delay the building code once
again. This action is so confusing it hurts. Why  would you pass a law and
encourage new business opportunities, than with the very same hand sign a
bill that puts these very same companies out of business.

I lost millions of dollars of investment money just over the past 2 weeks
with all that has happened on top of the millions of dollars that I have
lost due to the first 2 delays in the building code. The amount of money I
will lose because of the next delay that you allowed has my company in a
position that I am simply not sure I will recover from. Because of the
delay, customers of mine will not come to market in January and the expected
revenues I anticipated are gone. Investors will not even talk to me anymore
because they, like I, have no faith anymore in our legislative system to do
what's good for the people that got them elected over special interest, and
believe that you will continue to allow special interest to have their way
with the code and continue to push it back or make changes.

Keeping this business going for the last year has been extraordinarily
difficult due to these delays in the code. Lack of revenues has caused my
personal credit and company credit to be effected negatively, and find it
impossible to get any sort of traditional lending from banks. Now that you
allowed the code to be delayed again, investors are scared and traditional
lending is difficult, what do you suggest I do to stay in business????

What sort of lending programs are available for companies that Florida
Government has put on the brink of bankruptcy???

Dear Governor Bush:

I am not sure if you recieved this email, since you responded to the
first
one I sent both times. I send it again only for the very strong points
our
team has brought up on special session.

I know you must be extremely busy and I appreciate your timely response
to
my email. I also appreciate the attention you are paying to this very
important bill.

Our team has been reviewing the actions in Tallahassee with our legal
team
and other very interested parties around the country and would like to
ask
the following questions about the actions from earlier this week.

1: Due to the fact that the issue of the Florida Building Code was
outside
the purview of the call, doesn't the fact that President McKay allowed
this
bill to be heard during special session allude to special interest
activity
not in the best interest of the citizens of the state of Florida. As you
are
well aware this process started in 1996 with the building code study
commission. In 1998 the commission issued the single statewide building
code
and was agreed upon as being in the best interest of the state of
Florida.
It is now approaching 2002 and there are several states that have
adopted
building codes that incorporate hurricane protection, while our
legislature
has continuously delayed this very important code.

2: Many are questioning the legality of the actions taken during the
session
of the House pertaining to the delay of the Florida Building Code. Many
wonder if this was constitutionally correct.

3: Another point that has been brought to my attention is the language
in
the amendment to the Senate Bill 52C. The amendment states "design
professional who have been preparing construction documents in
anticipation
of the current Florida Law stipulating the implementation day for
January 1,
2002, may have their projects governed by the Florida Building Code that
would have been in effect". How can allowing this particular industry to
not
be financially affected by the delay, and other industries allowed to be
financially effected by the delay, not be a very harmful form of
discrimination.

As we are all aware right now more than ever, the safety and security of
our
families and children are of the utmost importance. The stringent
requirements of the new code, does nothing but enhance the safety and
security of our great state of Florida.

As I eluded to in my previous email, I ask once again for the
opportunity to
meet with you or speak to via telephone on this very important issue for
all
parties involved before you make judgment on this bill. There is a
solution
that everyone can be happy with.

Respectfully,

Subject: Florida Building Code


Dear Governor Bush,

I am writing to express my disappointment and disbelief that The Senate
and
House has once again voted to delay the Florida Building Code. I wrote
to
you last week expressing my feelings and giving you an understanding of
what
the severity of this action means to our company, but I feel I must do
it
again, since you are the last possible chance I have to save my
business.

My name is Peter Merhige and my company is Protective Glass Industries,
located in Ft Myers, Florida. My company was formed over 2 years ago for
the
purpose of developing and bringing to market a new product for the
hurricane
protection markets. The reason for forming the company and products was
for
the potential in the hurricane markets mainly due to the
development of the new Florida building code (THE CODE IN WHICH YOU
AGREED
WAS GOOD FOR FLORIDA) that contains hurricane protection. We have
designed
and have patents pending on the finest impact glass product in the
industry.
Not only does it protect from hurricane damage but also due to it's
insulating properties, reduces the cost of energy. We have spent well
over
$1,000,000 on the development and commercialization of our products and
due
to several delays in the statewide building code; we have lost millions
of
dollars. Over the last 2 days, I have lost close to $1 MILLION in
investment
money because of the actions in Tallahassee. Not only has our company
spent
over $1,000,000 but also there has been millions and millions of dollars
already spent to develop this code, along with millions and millions of
dollars spent by companies to enhance their products to meet the new
codes.
There are hundreds of companies ready to provide product for these new
building codes and there has been more than ample time to prepare for
it.

I do not know how to make this any clearer than to tell you that all of
mine
and all of my loyal employees' hard work to develop our products and
bring
them to market over the last 2+ years is over unless you help. We had
the
potential to create over 100 jobs for the state of Florida with revenues
over $100 million dollars over the next 3 years, which would obviously
be
put back into the Florida economy while protecting your citizens. We
have
close to 20 companies that were getting set to come to market with our
glass
the first of the year because of your code, and due to the delay, they
will
not until March (if the code doesn't get eliminated all together). Due
to
this delay and the uncertainty of Tallahassee which makes my investors
uncomfortable enough to not invest, I will not be able to keep the doors
open. Your are really my last hope to see that Tallahassee actually
thinks
of it's citizens over their own personal agendas.

We worked very hard to present ideas that would make sense for everyone
and
had some really good suggestions, but because of obvious personal
agendas,
we were ignored. Presently Senators McKay, Clary and Constatine along
with
Representative Bennet, who have businesses in the construction industry,
stated that Florida's counties were not ready for the code. Ourselves,
The
Florida League of Cities, AIF and many more, have proof through the DCA
that
only 8% of Florida was not ready to enforce the code.

We suggested that all counties not ready be given a 60 day delay to get
prepared and the other 92% who have worked extremely hard to do what you
wanted, enforce the code as scheduled. I cannot, even in my worst
nightmares, imagine how this would not satisfy everyone if that was
their
true objections. Obviously it was not and Politics once again was
Politics.

As I stated, you are our last chance. We are not alone. There are many
companies that will be put out of business because of this action. I do
know
you have the power to make this right. I am begging you for the
opportunity
to meet with you to politely express the feelings and concerns of our
company and our industry before you sign the bill to put us out of
business.
I don't think this is an unfair request since Tallahassee has
potentially
stripped my life from me.

I hope to hear from you or your office soon.

Respectfully,

Dear Governor:

A little over three years ago, you hired me to be part
of your team.  It has been, without a doubt, the
biggest honor of my life and also the most humbling.
You know how much I love you and that I would do
anything to help your continued success.

The past year has been a time of transition for me
with a new Chief of Staff.  It has been an honor to
work with Kathleen and help her get situated in
Tallahassee. I admire her talents and repect her
abilities tremendously.  However, over the last few
months, Kathleen and I both have come to realize that
she needs someone else with skills more suitable to
her management style.  

Over the last seven weeks, Kathleen and I have
discussed my performance, or lack there of, on a
couple of occasions.  I have not been able to provide
her with the consistent performance that she requires
and this has been a great source of frustration to her
and to me, as well.  She has made it abudantly clear
to me on numerous occasions, that she is exceedingly
frustrated with me.  At one point, I told her that
maybe she needed someone else in my job who could
better serve her needs. After a discussion, a weekend
of thought, we agreed that I would continue in my job,
sharing some of the resonsibilites - and that if
either one of us felt a change was needed, we would
say so. I am sorry to say, I was not successful in my
attempts to provide her with the performance she needs
from me.  On December 11, before the memorial ceremony
in the courtyard, she told me, "This is not working
out - you are not handling things the way I want them.
 I want Betty Jordan to sit at your desk and to manage
the office."  I told her I understood and that it
would happen.  After Kathleen left for the ceremony, I
told Betty Jordan what Kathleen said and that we
needed to implement her wishes ASAP so that we could
focus on getting the work done for her.  Betty Jordan
approached Kathleen after the ceremony and shortly
thereafter, Kathleen told me she should not have said
what she did regarding moving Betty to my position. 
She instructed me to work on a list on how best to
distribute some of my duties. I began working on the
list.  On Friday morning, 12/14, Betty Jordan told me
that Kathleen had told her the night before that she
wanted her (Betty) to sit at my desk and manage the
office.  At that point, Betty J. and I agreed that we
were both getting the same message from Kathleen and,
since last Friday, the two of us have tried to
accommodate Kathleen's request - by working together
to make the change happen.  On Friday, 12/14, Betty J.
talked with Brian and Frank and told them of
Kathleen's request, and I met with them also. I told
them that it was very clear to me that this situation
needed to be resolved ASAP and that it was becoming a
huge distraction - Kathleen needed the person that
could best work with her management style. 

Sir, your time is so valuable and I have over extended
what was to be a simple, thoughtful message to you.  I
wanted to let you know that in the best interest of
the office, and in helping Kathleen have the kind of
administrative support she needs, it is time for me to
leave my position with the COS and find another
opportunity within your administration to serve you,
if you still feel that I can be an effective memeber
of your team.  I have asked Brian and Frank to please
consider me for a transfer as soon as possible to
accommodate Kathleen's request.


Thank you for your time and for letting me be part of
your administration.  I will carry this great honor
with me always.   I cherish the opportunity you have
given me.  Thank you for your time and for your
thoughtful consideration.

Sincerely,
Kathy

Dear Governor Bush:

I am writing to ask if you for another favor. Would be willing to send out 
two letters? One to WJCT (our presenting PBS station) thanking them for their 
support and help in production of our special, Beyond Adversity TV and the 
other to Mr. Michael York (our host).

Mr. Michael Boylan (President & CEO) of the station has committed staff and 
resources to get the show out even though we have been unable to come up with 
the funding necessary. They really believe in what we are doing and have been 
invaluable to our foundation. 

Mr. York was kind enough to come to Florida without payment for his services 
and host the special.

If you are able to, I can send a draft of each letter and where to send them. 
We are diligently working to get the show out and these letters would help 
our situation. Hope to hear from you soon.

Subject:	IDEA Call In

Mr Irvin:

First I want to thank you for the opportunity to call in today. I was concerned when I realized there were only 2 of us calling in.

It was difficult to hear but I feel I was able to understand MOST of what was said.

When I shared my story and attempted to share why we are concerned I don't feel I was listened to . I feel the forum just kept saying ours is an isolated istance. What I shared several times is that ours is NOT isolated.

As a result of our struggles, I am now a trainer for our PTI and a Family Resource Specialist for our part C program. I am active in STAND our statewide advocacy network.I am out there being a part of the solution. I have personally stopped over 40 Due Processes from happening by helping parents address the school.

This has not prevented our school from destroying our family. 

When IDEA is reauthorized there must be a way for parents to be protected from schools who have VERY deep pockets. 

As I have shared we prevailed in Due Process but because the school refused to accept it we are still in litigation. She is in 3rd grade. This all began in K. The school refuses to count her in FTE so there is no protection under IDEA. Because we are in litigation OCR, OSEP and EEOC will not do anything to protect her. They are continually causing us to spend money we don't have because we can't stop or we won't get our attorney fees. We owe thosands of dollars to an attorney who is making nothing practically because he knows we can't pay him what we should.

The system as it is presently keeps parents from pushing for Due Process and Attorneys from taking cases.

This allows the schools to run rampant over the parents and childrens rights.

During the forum I heard ESE Directors saying that giving out proceedural safeguards causes parents to distrust the school and is an expensive part of the system. 

Oh my goodness! Please don't allow them to be able to stop explaining the parents rights. Maybe we can say after the first set is given the parents can say No thank you I don't need another copy but please make it be required that it is offered. 

Most of us could wallpaper our home with the paperwork we get at each meeting. IDEA did not accomplish the paperwork reduction anticiapted.

My solution was and continues to be- There has to be a watchdog that is NOT hired or paid for by the district in each area that monitors compliance. This person could be part of the PTI or a totally seperate agency. It can't be connected with the school in anyway.

The local districts around here have parents hired by the district or the FDLRS. Both of these situations are not really ones that will guarentee the persons job will be protected if they find a problem.

I have friends who work in these situations and they say If I say that I will be fired you go say it for me.

We have to find a way to stop the wasted money on Due Process and Appeals forced to happen by districts that refuse to do what is right. Parents and Childrens rights are not protected.

Please find a way to protect parents from these districts that refuse to do what is right.

My husband developed a program that he used for his EdD. He reduced discipline by 50% when he was a principal. 

His whole class scores were raised at the .10 significance level. They were all ESE or Title One students. 

While listening to the forum we kept hearing it will take time. It doesn't have to take years. The above scores happened in less than 1 school year.

Why did this happen? 

For one he incorporated Charecter Education into the currculum rather than just an add on program that was jammed in someplace. 

He helped the kids see that there was value in "doing right because its right to do right" not just so you get paid or rewarded.

He taught team effort to help EVERYONE be successful.

But most importantly he cared.

It didn't take any new materials it just took effort. 

We need to allow our teachers time be good teachers. Maybe then we will eliminate some of the problems we have right now.

If we allow them to be good teachers and hold them truly accountable for doing a good job,the they will strive to be better. Right now, we just beat them up if they are wrong and ignore what is good.

We also need to eliminate the bad. If a district is found to be purposefully ignoring parental and student rights people in TOP postions should be fired. Don't blame the teacher who does what they do just to keep their job.

When litigation is in place, the parents need a place to go that will protect them. They should not have to pay to be protected.

If the school does not prevail in DUE PROCESS the attorney fees should be given right there. It shouldn't have to wait until the school appeals and gets continuances and.....

It is expensive to have a child with a disability. We pay for Therapy because the school won't do a good job, we pay for medical bills and we pay for activities that we want to have our child in so they can "be Normal". We can't pay so the school can keep us in court.

They also said we can't solve it for just one child it has to be for the group. Don't you realize that each small victory makes it easier for the next one? Look at Rosa Parks, Martin Luther and his one man rebellion aginst the churh, look at Mother Teresa - The list could go on and on. 

As the saying goes I am only one I can't do evrything but I can do something.

Thank You for "listening". I will once again offer my services t be a part of teh solution. If I can ever do ANYTHING to solve this please let me know!

Sincerely,
DonaKay Hannagan

Subject: Business Groups--Economic Survey Results



This is a report on the results of the ninth week of economic surveys conducted by the Florida Retail Federation, National Federation of Independent Business, Associated Industries of Florida, the Florida Chamber of Commerce, and the Florida Hotel and Motel Association.  The surveys will continue through the end of December.

For the for the week ending December 3, the survey results across all industry groups show stability in sales and employment (compared to the same period last year).  As expressed in the previous report conditions do not seem to be getting noticeably worse or better right now. For sales compared to the same week last year, 43% of respondents indicated that they had lower sales, the same as reported last week.  The negative responses for employment (22% of respondents) are the same as the 22% recorded last week.  

Responses regarding the economic outlook are unchanged since last week. 

The occupancy survey results below show there have been sporadic signs of improvement in occupancy rates and average daily room rates in different regions of the state, but generally these measures are still significantly below last year's levels.

Good afternoon, here's an overview of my interview with USA Today reporter
Blake Morrison re DOT's reaction to The Road Information Program's (TRIP)
Urban Safety Study which will be released tomorrow:

   Safety remains our priority - although we are doing more than ever
   before, we continue to ask ourselves, "What else do we need to do to
   address this problem?"

   The Governor, the Florida Legislature, and Secretary Barry - along with
   our transportation partners - have lead the effort to dramatically
   increase transportation funding in the state over the past two years
   (Mobility 2000 & recent economic stimulus package) - this effort will
   save lives.

   I did not criticize TRIP's numbers or recommendations - in fact - other
   than keeping roads deiced during inclement weather, Florida is already
   taking all the steps to improve motorists, pedestrians, and bicyclists
   safety that TRIP recommends in its study.

   Even though the pure number of fatalities in Florida is going up, our
   fatality rate is going down.  Commercial Motor Vehicle (CMV) fatalities
   were down 11 percent in 2000.

   On the engineering side, we are spending $40 million to improve
   lighting, turn lanes, remove obstacles, etc.

   On the education and enforcement sides, we are spending $18 million on
   behavior issues like, alcohol countermeasures, occupant protection,
   bicycle/pedestrian safety, speed control, police traffic services, etc.

   The FSU/FAMU College of Engineering is doing a $450,000 study for DOT
   that will analyze all 1,802 fatalities on the state highway system in
   2000 to try to find out what could have prevented them.

   DOT's upper management is doing more through the Sterling process to
   improve transportation system safety.  We are addressing safety issues
   in each district by defining the problems & countermeasures.

   Morrison says the story should run in tomorrow's USA Today in Section A
   - probably page 3.

   I expect we'll get a few phone calls.  Ed Rice & I can handle the big
   picture up here.  Feel free to talk about your local issues.  Thanks,
   Dick Kane

Governor,
It was great getting your email. We are continually working on getting the 
word out about Family Table Time both locally and nationally. 
Our family is eagerly awaiting to hear from you to pursue our mutual goals. 
Your support along with Joseph Califano will help us reach our goal of 
getting Family Table Time tablecloths on tables and help you with your BHAG 
to reduce drug use in Florida by 50%! We are excited to share with you 
stories from our family as well as other families who have used the Family 
Table Time tool and how it has made a huge difference in helping families 
communicate.
Last night, at our Family Table Time meeting, a Kimball Family BHAG came up. 
The kids, Neal and I discussed the possibility of our family and yours 
enjoying a Family Table Time meeting together in Tallahassee! This seems to 
be the best way to show how the Family Table Time process works.

If we don't connect before the Holiday, many blessings your way.

The Kimball Family
Neal, Jill, Caitlin, Maggie, Kyle and Jimmy

Subject: Hospital closure


12/15/01 
Official: GPW closure not trouble-free 

7 jailed, 3 dead, 1 missing, official confirms 


The state's plan to shift G. Pierce Wood patients into community-based 
programs has gone very well, according to Celeste Putnam, director of 
mental health programs for the Florida Department of Children and 
Families. 

However, that doesn't mean the transition from the DeSoto County mental 
hospital has been trouble-free, she confirmed this week. 

Putnam, in a phone interview, responded to confirm that, of 215 patients 
discharged since January, seven have been jailed, three died and one was 
missing. 

Also, three of 22 Florida Assertive Community Treatment teams, which 
were 
launched in the past two years to provide supervision for discharged 
patients in their home communities, have run amok with problems. 

One of those teams, the Ruth Cooper Center's team in Fort Myers, 
disbanded 
and dropped its state contract. Putnam said DCF is working to hire 
another 
team "with a proven track record" to take over the Fort Myers clients. 

Another team, the Bolley Center's team in St. Petersburg, was barred for 
weeks from taking on new patients. But problems have since been 
corrected 
and the moratorium lifted. 

Another team also came under scrutiny elsewhere in the state until 
problems 
were corrected, Putnam said. 

But, she pointed out, the 22 teams now have 862 patients statewide, an 
average of 39 each. The teams will eventually supervise 100 each, or 
2,200 
patients statewide. 

"We're working with them very closely," Putnam said. "Overall, given 
that 
we have 22 teams, we think they are doing very well. 

"In fact, the Legislature in the last session asked us to start up three 
more FACT teams in the non-GPW areas," Putnam noted. 

Some 38 percent of GPW's discharged patients are now living 
independently 
under the supervision of the FACT teams, according to a report of a Nov. 
27 
GPW staff meeting. 

Only 6 percent -- 13 out of 215 -- were discharged to nursing homes, 
according to another DCF report. 

"Clients in independent living are maintaining," the GPW staff report 
said. 
"Most are taking (their) meds and keeping appointments." 

The closure plan calls for a GPW discharge outreach team to take a 
patient 
to the new community residence -- where a FACT team member was supposed 
to 
be waiting to meet the new client. 

Putnam confirmed reports, however, that on "a couple of occasions very 
early on in our discharge process" there was no FACT team member present 
to 
receive the patient. That problem was corrected, however, she said. 

"There were no serious incidents that resulted (from the failure to meet 
the patient)," Putnam said. 

Putnam confirmed, however, that a number of nursing homes and assisted 
living facilities turned away mental patients because they were too 
difficult to supervise. 

"The ALFs just could not meet their needs," Putnam said. 

However, she said, the candor of the ALFs allowed GPW staffers to find 
more 
suitable arrangements for the patients elsewhere. 

Since July, some 27 patients have been discharged to other state 
hospitals 
because they were too ill to be shifted into community programs. 

Since January, only two discharged GPW patients were involuntarily 
committed back into a state hospital, under the Baker Act. 

"We've reduced hospitalizations -- compared to 1999 -- by 77 percent," 
she 
said. 

At least nine patients left the state, and three left the country. 

Putnam said seven discharged patients wound up in jail. However, five 
have 
since been released, she said. 

None of the incarcerations were for "serious incidents, that I'm aware 
of," 
Putnam said. 

Three discharged patients have died. Putnam said she knows of no death 
due 
to neglect. The causes included heart attack, stroke and "progressive 
decline in a nursing home," Putnam said. 

The patient who apparently died of a heart attack, John Hicks, 56, stirs 
further questions, however. He died in the loft of his group home in 
East 
Fort Myers, according to a Lee County Sheriff's report. One of the 
paramedics who responded called an abuse hotline after noting the room 
was 
unsanitary. 

Putnam also said one patient disappeared from a Manatee County FACT team 
and hasn't been seen since. He left his apartment to visit his parents 
for 
Thanksgiving and never arrived. Police have been notified. 

"We are concerned about the fact he's missing but I don't think it's 
because of the FACT team," Putnam said. 

As of early December, the hospital had just 88 patients remaining. Of 
those, 38 were to be discharged into community programs and 50 to other 
state hospitals. 

There were 450 employees, with about 240 who have yet to line up new 
jobs, 
according to GPW newsletter.

Mr. Governor,
I would like to extend my deepest thanks for not cutting the funding that goes
to our program. I live here in Tallahassee and have been a Big for 2 years now.
My Little Brother, Derrick, is 12 and knows very little about state government
and the ways things have been rather hectic lately but i have been kept abrest
of the situation. I am also Vice-Chairman of the board of Directors for Big
Brothers/ Big Sisters of the Big Bend and we have been rather nervous lately as
the proposed cuts would have impacted us immensely for the upcoming fiscal
year. Thank you for your continued support of all mentoring agencies, your
efforts are not in haste.
My Thanks
Randy Wilson
Big Brother
Vice Chair Big Brothers Big Sisters of the Big Bend

Subject: Problems collecting child support...help!


I have been without a child support payment since Sept 1 for my 3 children.  I waited the required 30 days before contacting my attorney to get an income deduction order to have the child support payments taken straight out of my former husbands salary.  It took another 6 weeks to get the order signed by a judge.  On November 30, 2001, I was told by my former husband's employer that a check would be maild out that day and be sent to the state depository.  That was 16 days ago and when I call the hotline number to check on the status of the payments, they tell me that it has not been received or posted.  I now have to wait another 7 business days so they can run a trace on the check to see where it went. 
This is RIDICULOUS!  I have 3 children that depend on the child support payments to eat, have clothing, shelter, school, and then some.  I was wary about going through the state for collection of the child support because this has happened to so many of my divorced friends.  As it stands now, they will have no Christmas!  I have exhausted my savings to support them the last few months.  And to make matters worse, I have to go back to my attorney to get the back child support caught up along with collecting the back medical bills I am owed for the last year!  That will cost me another $725.00 that I do not have! 
Any help in expediting my payment through the system will be greatly appreciated.  My kids might be able to have a merry Christmas. 

Sincerely, 

Sonya C. Adkins

Brian & Frank:
 
Attached are a revised letter from the Secretary and a draft e-mail response for the Governor regarding Mr. Long's situation.  I regret any confusion as to the priority level attached to this or the tone in the previous letter.  I simply did not realize its severity.  As for the case, we did not give Mr. Long all the facts and we fess up in the letter.  In our response, he will receive a form (already filled out and needing just his signature) to get a partial refund.  However, the Board will ultimately decide whether or not he can proceed on his facility proposal.
 
Please let me know what else we can do to help.

In talking with Chris at the DC office the timing of the article has been moved to the first week of January to get the most eyeballs.
 
Typically web site traffic experiences a precipitous drop at the holiday stretch (underway).  Moreover, tidbits germane to the interview might surface in the interim and enrich the product.
 
On a different subject, the change of command for the Air Force Special Operations Command at Hurlburt will be Jan 16th which I am sure is known there.  However, the new commander, Lt Gen Paul Hester (an old squadron buddy from years ago) has a career lineage that you might want to make note of.  From 1986 to 1989, he was the Chief, U.S. House of Representatives liaison, Office of the Secretary of the Air Force for Legislative Liaison.  From 1997 to 1999 he was the Director, Legislative Liaison, Office of the Secretary of the Air Force at the Pentagon.

Thank you so much and I already have shared it with most. As I am sure you 
could tell we work as a team, two members of our team were not able to make 
it. One, Jean Pope an 18 yr. veteran advocate, As well as Nancy Fudge, a 
Consumer advocate very active for about the same time frame. Nancy and Lt. 
Governor Brogan have met on a number of occasions and correspond pretty 
regularly I believe. I was supposed to tell him hello for her and I goofed, 
with so many points we wanted to touch on, I forgot. It would make her day if 
she could get a note from him, she is going through a hard place in her 
recovery right now. Since the info we left has been sent to Policy and Budget 
Committee, we have come full circle with SDC. We started out with Mike 
Hansen, photo session and all, he has been very helpful to us. He was a hard 
sell, but the logic of more accountability for our buck, our funds working 
smarter finally won him over. Please relay a message to Governor Bush for me. 
Please, let Judge Kearney know he is behind her personal involvement in SDC 
and he agrees with Lt. Governor Brogans statement, programs to change the 
System for the better should be funded and progress should be monitored 
closely.

Dear Governor:



You are on a roll. All reports are that your attendance and your message were extremely well received by all in attendance at UF Commencement on Saturday. We need to be reminded what an important event the earning of a college degree continues to be to the recipient and to his or her family and friends. That is why UF has maintained the tradition that each graduate be individually recognized (and on Saturday congratulated by his or her Governor). 



This new governance system will work if it is implemented as it was proposed and designed. That includes removal of "state agency" status and devolvement of management and accountability to the Boards of Trustees.  It is crucial that this be completed at the Regular Session.



In order to achieve credibility, responsible restraint must be imposed on legislative leadership who in recent years have conferred "most favored nation" status on selected programs at certain state universities that are extremely expensive and clearly parochial. While this gains favor of the few it demonstrates that parity or even equity is not being considered by the imposers. The system is therefore criticized and rebuked. A governatorial veto is a remedy if prior restraint is not accomplished.



When a completed and credible governance system is in place (as opposed to being intended) UF and other state universities will be well positioned to conduct successful searches at all administrative levels.

also would like Lt. Governor Brogan's e-mail and snail mail address. I would

he did indicate he too felt funding should be forth coming for SDC, a new 
concept in changing the Mental Health Delivery System, in spite of the Budget 
cuts, to have more accountability for recovery of the mentally ill, as well 
as best use of the limited funds we do have. You were so much help and a 
delight to talk with. You seemed so interested in our plea for more funds for 
District 4, being the lowest funded District in Florida. Also understanding

Delivery System by doing business a different way.

He was well received - one of the largest ovations I remember and from a nearly packed O'Connell Center (about 11,000 people). 
 
When we roll out the announcment that I mentioned below, would the Governor want to be there for that occasion. We could, in fact, come to him in Tallahassee. Let me have your thoughts on this. David

Hi Brian - we have reviewed our admissions process and think we will guarantee admissions to the top 5 percent of graduates at all public high schools in Florida. How does this strike you? My best, David
 
P.S. Incidentally, we are adding Orlando Jones and Orlando Evans to our partnership with Raines, Ribault, and Miami Senior High. We will provide scholarships to the top 5 graduates of each of these schools and also work with the teachers on providing academic enrichment programs for them and their students. Stay well

Sir....I am embroiled here with a specific instance in my school having
to do 
with a certain student who may or may not be hooked into a possible
terrorist 
cell along with his dad.  The FBI is already involved as is the INS. You

don't need to bother everything here is under control. It just occurs to
me 
that it is an established fact that our enemies recruit for their ranks
from 
the high school age group. Might it not be an important tool to use to
be 
checking for islamists (EXTREMISTS) in the high schools?  I seriously
doubt 
that any of the school systems HUGE cadre of LIBERALS would report them.
It 
is just by happenstance that I stumbled across the one at my school and
knew 
enough to take action.  If my Principal finds out he'll try to have me
fired. 
 LIBERAL DEMOCRAT that he is!  Surely there must be a way to protect 
patriotic Floridians that suspect activity like this and report it.  IF
the 
kid is just "blowing smoke" that's okay.  He has 1st Amendment rights as

repulsive as they may be. But he claims his dad is going to take them
both 
into bin laden training camps overseas and the kid was born in Fasilibad

Pakistan. He brags that he and the entire building where he lives is
composed 
of illegal Islamist aliens.  I'll keep you posted.

If you'll send me a set of bumper stickers that say: "TEACHERS FOR JEB"
we 
have folks who will put them on their vehicles.  ALSO "Veterans for Jeb"

would be good.

Eric - I spoke with the principal of Raa Middle School, Donna Calloway,
(488-6287) and we are on for the photo shoot in the morning.  Consent forms
will be signed.  The Governor mentors from 8:00 - 9:00 a.m.  

I won't plan on being there unless you need men for anything...I think the
main thing is we would like two shots:  one tight in, close up of the two
working for magazine cover; other shots pulled out a bit for inset photos we
may need.

Thanks!  Liza

I am going to check with Governor's mentee's family; however, would you plan
on Wednesday morning shooting a picture of the Governor and his mentee?  It
will be for a cover shot on a magazine and also used  during national Mentor
Month in January.

I believe he mentors fist thing in the morning (7:30 - 8:30) at Raa Middle
School.  Tara can confirm the time for Wednesday. 

Would you let me know you are in receipt of the request, and I will
follow-up with you to confirm?

Governor - We are working on a story that will be on the cover of Family
Forum for January - which also happens to national Mentor Month (and by
resolution to be signed this week by the Cabinet members, Florida Mentor
Month as well).  

Family Forum has asked if the cover might be a picture of you working
with
your mentee.  Would you be in support of such an idea?  

If so, I would then need to approach his parents as well.  With National
Mentoring Month coming up, it would be nice to have a few such pictures
on
file.  Since we have not used almost no pictures of you and your mentee
to
date (over 2 years), I don't think there could be any question that we
are
using a student for publicity purposes.  We would be sure to mention
your
long history of mentoring in any article.

Frank --

Per Tara there's no time to shoot this this week, so we're targeting Wed 1/2
to shoot, which should still give us time to get the tape to the Secretary
as he's not leaving until 1/3 the day of the event (see below).

Two concerns:
1)  Wed 1/2 is the Gov's day and I have Leslie asking Miss Betty for time.
You might mention this to the Governor and/or Miss Betty to help grease the
wheels there.

2)  Clearly we must get the remarks locked down this week.  Are you here all
week?  I'm here through Friday, as long as needed.  Rick Smith and DEP are
working together to address the three points you mentioned, with an update
due today on when we can expect the bullets.  I just want to know if any
member of our team is skipping town early.

This is a report on the results of the ninth week of economic surveys conducted by the Florida Retail Federation, National Federation of Independent Business, Associated Industries of Florida, the Florida Chamber of Commerce, and the Florida Hotel and Motel Association.  The surveys will continue through the end of December.

Editors:

We have further proof that the so - called civil rights lobby is nothing but a bunch of self interested partisan Democrats. The Center for Fair and Open Testing's targeting Florida's Bright Futures program for criticism by suggesting that it is unfair to minorities is an obvious political hit; a clear attempt to antagonize Florida's black voters to turn out to defeat Jeb Bush in 2002 by making it appear as if the Bush administration is using Bright Futures to limit black access to college.

The Center for Fair and Open Testing in their zeal to criticize Bush administration did not mention that the Bright Futures Program was created years ago by a Florida Democrats. They also did not explain why only now, years after the program has been in place and in the midst of a Republican governor's re - election campaign do they raise these issues. And why hasn't the Center for Fair and Open Testing yet gone after Georgia's Hope Scholarship program, which was the model for Bright Futures, is being copied by many other states, and has existed for over ten years? (Hint: The governor of Georgia is a Democrat.) 

The debate over the fairness of standardized testing and access to quality education for minorities is one that needs to take place. However it is becoming clear that self interested leftist groups are the wrong people to represent blacks in this debate. For this situation the media must share blame. For instance, this newspaper should have asked tougher questions of the Center on why they were only targeting Florida's program and why now. This paper also should have mentioned the very large number of bright needy black college students in Florida that receive Bright Futures, and how it is in effect a legal nondiscriminatory replacement for race based scholarships. This newspaper did not, which I suppose is why you are called the Democrat. Thank you.

                 Good afternoon Governor. Happy Holidays to you and your 
                 family. Hope to see you sometime during the holidays. 

                 One of our constituents has a problem with the Department 
                 of Juvenile Justice. His name is John Wimberley ss# [REDACTED]. 
                 He has been scheduled for termination January 4, 2002 for 
                 budgetary reasons. He started working for the state 9/8/72 which

Sir....I am embroiled here with a specific instance in my school having to do 
with a certain student who may or may not be hooked into a possible terrorist 
cell along with his dad.  The FBI is already involved as is the INS. You 
don't need to bother everything here is under control. It just occurs to me 
that it is an established fact that our enemies recruit for their ranks from 
the high school age group. Might it not be an important tool to use to be 
checking for islamists (EXTREMISTS) in the high schools?  I seriously doubt 
that any of the school systems HUGE cadre of LIBERALS would report them.  It 
is just by happenstance that I stumbled across the one at my school and knew 
enough to take action.  If my Principal finds out he'll try to have me fired. 
 LIBERAL DEMOCRAT that he is!  Surely there must be a way to protect 
patriotic Floridians that suspect activity like this and report it.  IF the 
kid is just "blowing smoke" that's okay.  He has 1st Amendment rights as 
repulsive as they may be. But he claims his dad is going to take them both 
into bin laden training camps overseas and the kid was born in Fasilibad 
Pakistan. He brags that he and the entire building where he lives is composed 
of illegal Islamist aliens.  I'll keep you posted.

If you'll send me a set of bumper stickers that say: "TEACHERS FOR JEB" we 
have folks who will put them on their vehicles.  ALSO "Veterans for Jeb" 
would be good.

Dear Governor, To voice our opinions, my husband and I are not in favor of
the electrical companies deregulation in our state. We are quite happy with
FPL. Their rates are reasonable, service is dependable and after Hurricane
Andrew, they put back the power in an amazingly short time. With
deregulation, you actually let in other power companies who will be using
FPL lines who will have to pay for that use, thus creating a middle man and
higher prices. From the article in the Miami Herald,12/2/01, Katie Baur said
that most Floridians are for this. We are not. The real problem with
utilities in this state is the amount of taxes tacked on to utility bills:
my FPL bill was $143.75 and the taxes were $21.32, 14.8% in taxes. My cell
phone has 21% in taxes. These are unfair and obviously too high. Do
something about the taxes and forget about deregulation. The money that both
sides are spending in lobbying,could be used for people's benefits instead.

I have spoken to Major Cyrus Brown, who is the Troop Commander  in Tampa.
He will personally contact Mrs. Wilson today, and set up a meeting with her.

Please ensure Governor Bush that we have attempted to meet with Mrs. Wilson
in the past.  We have had numerous contacts with her and offered to set up a
meeting that would include a representative from the States Attorney Office
in Hillsborough County.  We felt that the SAO representative would be
beneficial in explaining to her why criminal charges are not applicable in
this unfortunate incident.  She informed us that she did not want to meet,
but has apparently changed her mind.  

She will be contacted today, and a meeting will be scheduled by Major Brown.

If additional information is needed, please call.

Subject: RE: Questions about my son's death


Dear Governor Bush,

Thank you for acting on my request for answers in the manner in which
the
FHP handled the investigation of my son, Richard McKeefery's death by a
traffic incident that occurred on 04/24/01 in Tampa.

Unfortunately, Colonel Knight continues to direct my inquiries to
Captain
Tharpe of the Tampa patrol division who does not return my phone
messages.  He has never contacted me and I continue to get his answering
device.

I'd also like the DMV to explain why Martin's license was not suspended
on 04/02/01 since he had accumulated 14 pts in an eight month period by
that date.

If you read my list of questions in it's entirety, you're aware that
several of Florida's agencies has a lot to answer for in the manner in
which my son and our family has been treated.

I understand that Cynthia Holden handed you a letter and the list of
questions personally, she's been a God send and I'm proud to have a
person of her moral strength and character helping us in this fight for
justice.

It's really difficult when state legislatures claim that the law is
unimportant, that it wouldn't have mattered if Martin's license would
have been suspended because people still drive on suspended licenses. 
What they seem to fail to recognize is that because he had a pending DUI
from another crash he caused on 03/02/01 and had caused another crash on
04/13/01, less than two weeks before killing my son that more would have
been done to get him off the road.  They knew how dangerous this man's
driving was and continue to deny responsibility in their role by
allowing
him to keep a legal license.

Even if he'd still been on the road, he'd automatically be serving time
for the death of my son now instead of receiving a careless driving
ticket for something which is obviously manslaughter and he has shown
absolutely no remorse to our family for his actions.

I believe anyone who has a conscience cannot turn away from this
occurrence and will do what they can to see that the current laws are
followed and to provide legislation that will require blood testing for
drugs/alcohol in the case of severe injury/fatality in a traffic
incident.  Victims have no choice in this during the autopsy, where are
their rights?  When people are given drug tests by employers to simply
stock shelves don't the victim/victim's familiy have a right to know if
drugs/alcohol played a role in their loved one's death or injury? 
Shouldn't the culprit get more than a simple fine, less than a speeding
ticket for killing someone negligently?

Thank you for your time and effort in this matter.

Sincerely,
Laura A. Wilson

Governor - We are working on a story that will be on the cover of Family

resolution to be signed this week by the Cabinet members, Florida Mentor
Month as well).  

Family Forum has asked if the cover might be a picture of you working with
your mentee.  Would you be in support of such an idea?  

If so, I would then need to approach his parents as well.  With National
Mentoring Month coming up, it would be nice to have a few such pictures on
file.  Since we have not used almost no pictures of you and your mentee to
date (over 2 years), I don't think there could be any question that we are
using a student for publicity purposes.  We would be sure to mention your
long history of mentoring in any article.

County will lose its DJJ office because of belt-tightening, however we will

no, Secretary has known Mr. Iacobucci over the years -- however, not close
personal friends), was someone fired to create the position (no position was
vacant), why he was hired when so many were being laid-off (hired before
lay-offs were known because of the level of expertise he brings to the

Please ensure Governor Bush that we have attempted to meet with Mrs. Wilson

Subject: RE: Questions about my son's death


Dear Governor Bush,

Thank you for acting on my request for answers in the manner in which
the
FHP handled the investigation of my son, Richard McKeefery's death by a
traffic incident that occurred on 04/24/01 in Tampa.

Unfortunately, Colonel Knight continues to direct my inquiries to
Captain
Tharpe of the Tampa patrol division who does not return my phone
messages.  He has never contacted me and I continue to get his answering
device.

I'd also like the DMV to explain why Martin's license was not suspended
on 04/02/01 since he had accumulated 14 pts in an eight month period by
that date.

If you read my list of questions in it's entirety, you're aware that
several of Florida's agencies has a lot to answer for in the manner in
which my son and our family has been treated.

I understand that Cynthia Holden handed you a letter and the list of
questions personally, she's been a God send and I'm proud to have a
person of her moral strength and character helping us in this fight for
justice.

It's really difficult when state legislatures claim that the law is
unimportant, that it wouldn't have mattered if Martin's license would
have been suspended because people still drive on suspended licenses. 
What they seem to fail to recognize is that because he had a pending DUI
from another crash he caused on 03/02/01 and had caused another crash on
04/13/01, less than two weeks before killing my son that more would have
been done to get him off the road.  They knew how dangerous this man's
driving was and continue to deny responsibility in their role by
allowing
him to keep a legal license.

Even if he'd still been on the road, he'd automatically be serving time
for the death of my son now instead of receiving a careless driving
ticket for something which is obviously manslaughter and he has shown
absolutely no remorse to our family for his actions.

I believe anyone who has a conscience cannot turn away from this
occurrence and will do what they can to see that the current laws are
followed and to provide legislation that will require blood testing for
drugs/alcohol in the case of severe injury/fatality in a traffic
incident.  Victims have no choice in this during the autopsy, where are
their rights?  When people are given drug tests by employers to simply
stock shelves don't the victim/victim's familiy have a right to know if
drugs/alcohol played a role in their loved one's death or injury? 
Shouldn't the culprit get more than a simple fine, less than a speeding
ticket for killing someone negligently?

Thank you for your time and effort in this matter.

Sincerely,
Laura A. Wilson

Thank you for your informative email.  I have been following this issue
closely for quite some time.  

Because of the myriad of issues involved in the area, I have written
Secretary Struhs regarding the permitting issues involved with the
wastewater treatment and asked for his assistance in ideas.  Our staffs are
meeting in the first or second week of January.  The Air Force attorney has
requested that we all meet on January 10th, here in Tallahassee.  At that
time we can discuss most of the issues associated with the base and the
waste water treatment issues as well.  I believe Obed Dorceus is
coordinating that meeting with you.

I look forward to finding solutions to our joint concerns and wish you a
happy holiday until then.

Attachments:	McKay Const Amend Summary.doc

Sen. McKay held a press conference this morning to officially unveil his "tax reform" plan. Standing beside Sen. McKay were senators Lee, Latvala, King, Pruitt, and Silver.  McKay also indicated that Sen. Webster would have been there if not for a scheduling conflict.

There was not much in the way of new information revealed.  The rationale for the effort is that the tax system is antiquated, there is an overdependence on tourism, there is a looming $4 billion revenue crisis because of repeal of the estate tax and loss of revenues to internet sales, the system is not fair to Florida families (it is regressive).

Sen. McKay outlined the specifics of the proposed constitutional amendment (see attached for details).  He (and Sen. King) emphasized that this effort is not like what happened in the late 1980's.  That was a tax increase, McKay's plan is not because it is revenue neutral.  Whether or not the plan would be revenue neutral beyond the first year was not discussed, nor did the press ask the question.  Hank Fishkind, in answering a press question said, "Are we going to keep increasing the tax rate? or broaden the base?"

Also emphasized several times, was that the plan is flexible in that the Legislature will be able to retain about $7.5 billion in exemptions beyond the necessities specified by Sen. McKay in order to assure that concerns about economic competitiveness are addressed.  This will probably be a standard response to questions about specific exemptions that will invariably arise.  Hank Fishkind said that this will not be a big issue for businesses and that businesses pass through all taxes to their customers.

Figures were cited that the plan will save Florida households a total of $750 million annually, averaging $133 per household.  Hank Fishkind indicated that these numbers are based on assumptions about how much of the current tax and proposed tax is payed by households and businesses.  Since there is no specific list of exemptions to be repealed, the assumptions are basically arbitrary.  Based on my experience, these estimates are probably fairly simplistic SWAGS.

Noteably absent from the discussion was any substantiation of the stability argument.  Improvements in tax base stability will very much depend on which exemptions are ultimately repealed.  Again, as long as there is no specific list of exemptions to be repealed, the stability effects of the proposal can not be evaluated.

Subject: Clarification from audrey peterman



Can we find common ground?
By Audrey Peterman

The headline "Have they no shame?" appearing over my letter in last week's 
Broward Times, casts my comments in an entirely different light than 
intended. It is not my purpose to demean anyone. I'm trying, instead, to 
remind us that "community" implies "working together for the common good."

For the past five years I have written copiously about the Earth and our 
environment. My goal has been to remind everyone, and African Americans in 
particular, that as the child in the womb depends on the mother, so we
depend 
upon the planet. Respect for Mother Earth should be the most natural force
in 
man. If bad decisions continue to be made that trash our planet, it doesn't 
matter that we didn't make them. We will be the first affected. Therefore, 
for our own protection and survival, we have to become a force for good in 
America's dealings with our Earth.

The Wingate Superfund site in Fort Lauderdale, literally in our own 
backyards, is the perfect example of how this principle works. When we 
learned:

 that every piece of waste and garbage produced in Palm Beach, Broward and 
Dade from 1954 to 1978 had either been incinerated or buried in that 
landfill;
  that the records of everything trucked to the site had mysteriously
burned 
up in a fire at the City of Fort Lauderdale; 
 that the African American community in a one-mile radius surrounding the 
site had HIGHER RATES OF FIVE DIFFERENT KINDS OF CANCERS than all other 
neighborhoods in the state;
 that the whole mess sits on top of the Biscayne acquifer, from which South

Floridians get our drinking water;

We assumed that 
 the state, federal and local Department of Environmental Protection, and 
the City of Fort Lauderdale that operated the site, would immediately put 
their best minds to work on how to fix the problem.
 These agencies would work with members of the Environmental Justice 
community, and the mainstream environmental community, locally and across
the 
country, to get the site cleaned up with the best technology available, 
emphasis on protecting human health and the environment. The Fortune 500s
and 
other corporations that dumped at the site, would pay the cost of cleaning
it 
up.
 Social justice organizations, especially the NAACP, would work to educate 
the local community about the issues, and champion the needs of the affected

neighborhoods;
 Medical testing, studies and assistance would be provided free to these 
people. 

Instead, the exact opposite has happened. Elgin Jones' story in The Times, 
Dec. 7 illustrates how this result came about. My letter was meant to remind

the community that it doesn't have to be this way, that our actions, or 
inactions, help determine the kind of leadership we have, and ultimately,
the 
kind of community that we build, together.

A congressional aide told me earlier this year: "One letter to your 
Congressperson (City, County, School Board etc.) gets a letter in response;
5 
letters get attention, 10 letters get ACTION!" 

So, you get the picture! Organize! Write letters to the Editor, to the City 
and County Commission (and not just to the person who represents you, but to

ALL members), outlining the needs of your community. Participate. Make the 
system work FOR you, taxpaying citizens!

Dear Governor: 

Thank you for returning Harold Fitzgerald's telephone call so promptly.  It was a pleasure to speak with you and briefly acquaint you with two issues that are vitally important to Gumdrop Books.  

Issue One:  Being placed on the Florida approved book vendor list.  

Due to the fact that Florida changed its method of bid notifications from a packet to a postcard, several book vendors, including Gumdrop, did not receive the postcard inviting us to bid for a place on the approved vendor list.  When we realized that the normal deadline to apply was close, we contacted the Florida Department of Education and were told that the deadline had passed.  They said they were sorry that we had not received the postcard but that we would be able to apply in the autumn to get on the list along with other vendors who also did not received the postcard.  This we did in early September but we were told that a decision would not be made until early December.  With follow-up calls, we found that Genny Boynton with the State Purchasing Department (tel: 850-488-7996) was handling our application.  However, she had been out of the office for several weeks and our application sat on her desk.  

Last week we finally spoke with Ms. Boynton only to learn that she had misplaced our bid.  We immediately faxed her a copy and followed up with her the next day by which time she had found the original bid.  When we asked what the next step should be, she informed us that after our bid left her desk in about two weeks, it would go to someone else for approval.  This could take four to six weeks before we could be on the list.

We explained the urgency in getting on the list as we are unable to sell books to our Florida librarian customers who are growing impatient while waiting.  Naturally, impatience will become lost sales unless we can get this resolved immediately.  Ms. Boynton called our office on Monday, Dec. 10th to let us know that Gumdrop Books was not registered in Florida, which we immediately rectified.

Waiting another six weeks to get on the list will substantially add to the loss of business we have already incurred in your state.

Issue Two:  1% vendor surcharge fee on contractors' sales.  

This year the Florida Department of Management Services added this surcharge which must be paid 15 days after the end of each contract quarter.  Failure to comply with this new requirement will result in the supplier being removed from the state contract.  To the best of our knowledge, Florida is the only state that requires a quarterly payment in order to do business within its borders.  This surcharge will not help generate sales and in fact will increase our prices when the funds allocated to purchase our books are, in fact, normally state funds.

Again, thank you for your willingness to hear our concerns on both of these issues.  We are hopeful that with your assistance, some resolution to these issues may be found in a very timely fashion.

Our toll free number is 1-800-821-7199.  Vice President Jeff Fitzgerald's personal email is jeff@gumdropbooks.com.  He is looking forward to hearing from you.  Thank you again for taking time to consider these issues..

According to Dave Pridgeon, Deputy Director for Institutions at DC, the following is the status on Mr. Hathaway. This conflicts with the information below:

This individual is in the custody of Escambia county jail as he is a state witness in a criminal case. He has been "out to court" since 12-05-01. It could be he is exchanging testimony for some change in sentence but this is unknown. 

He is not scheduled for release until 2014 
There have been no reports of use of force on this inmate. 
There is no DC medical record indicating liver or any other cancer. 
On 5-14-01 a lesion was biopsied from his lip and the reports were clear. 
He was scheduled for some follow up medical tests on 11-20-01 but did not fast for them as instructed, so they were not conducted.

When he left for Escambia county he was showing no distress of any kind 
It is noted that Mr. Hathaway has a very extensive record including 2 prior prison terms and multiple community supervision sentences. He is 30 years old and has been involved in the adult criminal justice system since 1990. 

As you know, the state would be responsible to treat him for any illness, including cancer. There were no budget cuts to the agency's health care budget. It is unclear whether Mr. Hathaway's fianc, Starla, is inferring that DC officers beat him, other inmates or jail personnel. According to Mr. Pridgeon, there is nothing on the DC record to indicate anything of this nature. With more information we may be able to ask DC to initiate an investigation if warranted. I will gladly speak with Starla to try to get some clarity regarding her concerns if I could receive some way to speak with her. 

Please let me know if I can provide further information or assist in any way.

  My fiance has cancer, around the crust of his liver. The State has 
done a budget cut and he may not get the treatment he needs. He was 
suppose to be released November 28, but the Prosecuting Attorney is 
fighting it. If he stays in there, the cancer will spread and he could 
die. 
  He has lost a large amount of weight and he has been beat on, by the 
guards as well. He has just been transferred to the Escambia County 
jail. I'm not sure whats going on. Please help me anyway you can.

Dear Governor Bush:

       With all that is going on in the Great State of Florida, the Nation, and the World I will try to keep this e-mail brief.  In your speech to the Florida League of Cities Downtown Redevelopment Seminar held in Miami you stated that your e-mail is one of the best ways to get in touch with you.
       As an elected official I know first hand how hard it is to keep track of everything that is going on.  However, when I feel someone is treated improperly I work hard to rectify the situation.  
       You can imagine how hard it is to survive as a small business man these days.  As if the economy were not bad enough, one of your agencies is causing me unnecessary problems.  I submitted an application to the Department of Business and Professional Regulation, Board of Funeral Directors and Embalmers to open a new cinerator (crematory) facility.  In my twenty-one years in this profession I have received one minor complaint which currently pending against me.  The Departments Legal Advisor (Charles Tunnicliff) has specifically stated to my attorney that the staff of the Department is improperly using a statute to deny my final inspection.  I invested $100,000.00 in the construction and equipment for the cinerator facility.  I hired two additional staff members to operate the facility.  When I made application to the Department in May/2001 I was told my inspection would take place in 30 days.  Well, its now December and I have been forced to sell the crematory at a loss, I have suffered tens of thousands of dollars in lost income, and I am being forced to terminate the two employee's.  As if that were not enough, the Department is denying my request to have my $400.00+ application fee refunded.  They have taken no action on my application.  I should at least be entitled to a refund of my application fee.  
       Again, (in summary) I lose a new business venture, I lose tens of thousands of dollars in income, I am adding two more people to the unemployment lines, and I can't even get my lousy 400+ dollars back.  Needless, to say I am appalled at the Departments handling of this matter.
       Governor Bush, I believe you are a sincere, honest man, who cares a lot about all of us.  I support you and all that you have tried to do to downsize and limit government spending.  I have been one of your most outspoken supporters in local and statewide political circles.  Of course having the former Chairwoman of the Brevard Republican Executive Committee as a mother; in her eyes Republicans can do no wrong (especially a Bush)!  Please take this matter under consideration.  I want to continue to be in your corner as we go into this election year.  I need your help!  Persons working for you should promote commerce and the economy not help tear it down.

"God Bless America"

 Mr. Governor, thank you for asking. Sorry it has taken a few days to get
back to you.  We are having quite a ride here! Business is good; we continue
to develop and improve the iCommunicator system. Patent should be approved
in the next month or so. We are in discussions with various investment firms
to raise capital for expansion and continued product development. 

 We are also in negotiations with Rochester Institute of Technology and the
National Institute for the Deaf to help advance the product and carry out
substantiating research. But the "Big" news is that we are in negotiations
with The Walt Disney Company to co-produce a product for early intervention
of children ages 6 months to 14 years old who are deaf or hard of hearing or
have various communications and learning disabilities. It is an exciting
time here in Sarasota at ISI. Thank you for taking the time to ask how we
are doing. You never cease to amaze me in the way you express real concern
for your constituents. 

 When I told our five year old daughter, Erin, that I was writing a letter
to our Governor she knew who you were and asked me to tell you Merry
Christmas so, there you have it, mission accomplished! Thank you, again, and
to you and your family the very best of Holidays...Mike

Dear Jeb:

Several months ago we corresponded by e-mail, concerning Betsy McCormacks 
friend, Riley Burchfield #042008 incarcerated in Avon Park.  Betsy aksed me 
if I would follow-up with you to see if there has been any progress made to 
review his case and to consider a pardon. If you will recall, Riley has 
served 25 years and doesn't have a presumptive release date until 2015. Riley 
is a committed Christian and Betsy is trying to help him any way she can.  If 
you need Betsy to send the information again, I will be happy to convey that 
to her.

Jeb, you are always right there for me and I love you for it.  I am so sorry 
you & Columba will not be at our Humanitarian dinner this year, but we are 
honored that you have agreed to do a video to present the award to Mel 
Martinez.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am writing this letter to comment on the "newer, kinder" Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.  I certainly have not found them to be any less frustrating than usual.
 
Have you looked at the Provider Application process lately?  We I have!  I am in process of completing an application for a physician who will be joining our group soon.  When I signed onto the CMA website to print the application, I was overwhelmed, to say the least, to find that one section of the application was 57 pages long, one section was 67 pages long, one section was 31 pages long and just the reassignment of benefits form was 9 pages long.  Maybe you would not be intimated by the sheer volume of these applications but a simple working person out here in the trenches is.  It was my understanding that the new applications, effective November, 2001, were simpler, clearer and easier. But looking at these I sure don't feel that they are simpler, clearer and easier.  
 
I did receive The Florida Medicare B Update on Saturday, December 1 which included information regarding a "FREE" Provider Enrollment Workshop to be held in Jacksonville, FL on December 13 or 14th.  It stated that we should "Register Early, because "Seating is limited."  However, there was no phone number, fax number etc to facilitate that happening.  When I finally did get a phone number for Provider Education (not an 800# by the way) 904-791-6422 and I began calling on Monday, Dec. 3 to register I was instructed to leave a detailed message.  I did this including my phone number, fax number, and e-mail address where I could be reached.  I noted that I needed confirmation that I would be able to attend so that I could make travel and motel arrangements as I am approx 6-7 hours away.  I have now made 26 long distance phone calls as well as spending my time which is very valuable to me. By the time I incur travel/hotel costs along with the time and phone calls, this certainly will not have been "FREE" to me.  By Monday, if I were to get a response by then, I will have only 2 days left to make arrangements to attend. 
 
Let me stress, it is very important to me to attend this workshop!!   Having been through the application process several times previously with disastrous results I was so excited to think that I might get my "questions answered directly by a Medicare Expert" who will give me "on-the-spot" assistance in completing and submitting my enrollment applications.  
 
I have always supported you and felt that you were supportive of the people in this state and the medical community.  I will certainly appreciate it if you can offer any assistance to a small rural town physician's office in your state.

Subject: RE: Questions about my son's death


Dear Governor Bush,

Thank you for acting on my request for answers in the manner in which the
FHP handled the investigation of my son, Richard McKeefery's death by a
traffic incident that occurred on 04/24/01 in Tampa.

Unfortunately, Colonel Knight continues to direct my inquiries to Captain
Tharpe of the Tampa patrol division who does not return my phone
messages.  He has never contacted me and I continue to get his answering
device.

I'd also like the DMV to explain why Martin's license was not suspended
on 04/02/01 since he had accumulated 14 pts in an eight month period by
that date.

If you read my list of questions in it's entirety, you're aware that
several of Florida's agencies has a lot to answer for in the manner in
which my son and our family has been treated.

I understand that Cynthia Holden handed you a letter and the list of
questions personally, she's been a God send and I'm proud to have a
person of her moral strength and character helping us in this fight for
justice.

It's really difficult when state legislatures claim that the law is
unimportant, that it wouldn't have mattered if Martin's license would
have been suspended because people still drive on suspended licenses. 
What they seem to fail to recognize is that because he had a pending DUI
from another crash he caused on 03/02/01 and had caused another crash on
04/13/01, less than two weeks before killing my son that more would have
been done to get him off the road.  They knew how dangerous this man's
driving was and continue to deny responsibility in their role by allowing
him to keep a legal license.

Even if he'd still been on the road, he'd automatically be serving time
for the death of my son now instead of receiving a careless driving
ticket for something which is obviously manslaughter and he has shown
absolutely no remorse to our family for his actions.

I believe anyone who has a conscience cannot turn away from this
occurrence and will do what they can to see that the current laws are
followed and to provide legislation that will require blood testing for
drugs/alcohol in the case of severe injury/fatality in a traffic
incident.  Victims have no choice in this during the autopsy, where are
their rights?  When people are given drug tests by employers to simply
stock shelves don't the victim/victim's familiy have a right to know if
drugs/alcohol played a role in their loved one's death or injury? 
Shouldn't the culprit get more than a simple fine, less than a speeding
ticket for killing someone negligently?

Thank you for your time and effort in this matter.

Sincerely,
Laura A. Wilson

Dear Governor: 

Thank you for returning Harold Fitzgerald's telephone call so promptly.  It was a pleasure to speak with you and briefly acquaint you with two issues that are vitally important to Gumdrop Books.  

Issue One:  Being placed on the Florida approved book vendor list.  

Due to the fact that Florida changed its method of bid notifications from a packet to a postcard, several book vendors, including Gumdrop, did not receive the postcard inviting us to bid for a place on the approved vendor list.  When we realized that the normal deadline to apply was close, we contacted the Florida Department of Education and were told that the deadline had passed.  They said they were sorry that we had not received the postcard but that we would be able to apply in the autumn to get on the list along with other vendors who also did not received the postcard.  This we did in early September but we were told that a decision would not be made until early December.  With follow-up calls, we found that Genny Boynton with the State Purchasing Department (tel: 850-488-7996) was handling our application.  However, she had been out of the office for several weeks and our application sat on her desk.  

Last week we finally spoke with Ms. Boynton only to learn that she had misplaced our bid.  We immediately faxed her a copy and followed up with her the next day by which time she had found the original bid.  When we asked what the next step should be, she informed us that after our bid left her desk in about two weeks, it would go to someone else for approval.  This could take four to six weeks before we could be on the list.

We explained the urgency in getting on the list as we are unable to sell books to our Florida librarian customers who are growing impatient while waiting.  Naturally, impatience will become lost sales unless we can get this resolved immediately.  Ms. Boynton called our office on Monday, Dec. 10th to let us know that Gumdrop Books was not registered in Florida, which we immediately rectified.

Waiting another six weeks to get on the list will substantially add to the loss of business we have already incurred in your state.

Issue Two:  1% vendor surcharge fee on contractors' sales.  

This year the Florida Department of Management Services added this surcharge which must be paid 15 days after the end of each contract quarter.  Failure to comply with this new requirement will result in the supplier being removed from the state contract.  To the best of our knowledge, Florida is the only state that requires a quarterly payment in order to do business within its borders.  This surcharge will not help generate sales and in fact will increase our prices when the funds allocated to purchase our books are, in fact, normally state funds.

Again, thank you for your willingness to hear our concerns on both of these issues.  We are hopeful that with your assistance, some resolution to these issues may be found in a very timely fashion.

Our toll free number is 1-800-821-7199.  Vice President Jeff Fitzgerald's personal email is jeff@gumdropbooks.com.  He is looking forward to hearing from you.  Thank you again for taking time to consider these issues..

Jeb: 
     First: Thank you so much for having us to the Mansion. I felt badly, though, as it seemed that you and Columba had a not-very-pleasant drill for the entire evening. Obviously, it was not the venue for chit chat.
   We also were able to talk to Governor Brogan, which was a pleasure. He is a fine guy and very bright. I feel so badly about his loss. That must be very difficult to handle, particularly at the holiday season. I also received a lot of nice compliments about last year's efforts. Tallahassee is much never on more than two hours sleep a night!
    Second: Thanks again for the responsiveness of your administration over the past several weeks. It was a bit exasperating and time-consuming, but the willingness to work at it until it was right in this first step was much appreciated by me and my colleagues.
     Third: I have a personal letter that I have written for your brother. What is the best way of getting it to him?
     Fourth: Is it ever possible for you to have a non-official, kick-back dinner, preferably down here, but up there would be O.K. I guess, or even better, Key West.
     Fifth: I am working very hard on some things for Bay Point and love working with Brian. he is so bright, so dedicated, and so energetic. He is nothing short of excellent. 
     Sixth: I hope all goes well for you and your family over the holiday season. The pressure must be extraordinary  clearly more than you bargained-for.
    Seventh: Thanks for the great job that you are doing. I am still delighted to be continuously happy about what I read about your policies as Governor. Joe

Subject:	FW: Avon Park

Secretary Moore: 

I need to bring to your attention an escalating issue between the Dept of
Corrections and the Air Force's Avon Park Bombing Range.  Avon Park provided
land to the state which is now used by DOC for prison.  In the deed, the
state is responsible for upkeep of utilities (e.g., electical, sewage,
water).  The water and sewage system in desparate need of repair--with its
current condition of mal-repair detrimentally affecting Avon Park
operations.  This issue is currently bogged down in your legal shop (Obed is
handling).  

Avon Park is getting very frustrated with DOC as non-action to needed
repairs is affecting their installation.  

We are involved because we work extensively w/ the military bases in the
state and Avon Park officials have come to us to assist in resolution.  Can
you help? 


Avon Park Bombing Range Fact Sheet

	*	Quitclaim deed between the AF and the state in 1971 called
for joint use of utility lines and facilities, with the state agreeing to
maintain all the utilities (deed was to the Board of Trustees of the
Internal Improvement trust Fund)

	*	Corrections(DOC)  was designated as the lead agency, the
land transferred houses a prison

	*	The AF contacted DOC regarding electrical utility repairs
needed at the range and encountered difficulty from the DOC in agreeing that
the state was truly responsible for the costs of maintenance.  

	*	At one point, DOC referred the matter to DEP stating it was
DEP's concern because it was regarding a state lands issue and they are the
appropriate agency to handle the matters

	*	DEP determined that the state was responsible for the costs
and facilitated an agreement with the Peace River Electric Co-op (the local
electric utility company) to assume responsiblity for the repair and
maintenance.  The electrical systems are no longer an issue. 

	*	Problems with the water and sewage systems have arisen
recently--including some sewage spillages--which the AF has done emergency
repairs on the system to prevent environmental disasters.  DEP issued a
letter to DOC that it was responsible for finding an entity to maintain the
water and sewage systems. 

	*	DOC has now reverted to the original position that it is
unclear whether the state is responsible for the utility systems, reversing
an earlier affirmative determination.

It did.  Your team now has a good understanding of how the program will
work.  My assessment is that they are very excited about the impact this
will have on Florida tourism.  Turns out it is even more multi-faceted
than
I anticipated.  Not only will we drive tourism dollars to Florida, we
also
both get a marketing boost associated with two leaders working together.

We will begin working Monday on linkages to the flausa.com "hot deals"
section of your website, the creative associated with the banner ads we
will
be running on the Yahoo! network, content we want to highlight on the
promotions sections of Yahoo! Travel and Lodging, and getting a better
understanding of how Florida wants to consume the inventory.  Very

I will be in Tallahassee Monday to complete the agreement with the state
technology office.  As you know, it must be signed by Friday of next
week,
December 21 for the advertising program to go into effect, so I am
prepared
to stay all week if that is required.

Yesterday Governor Bush approved moving forward with our agreement.
That
means we will need to meet with the right people in Florida to determine
how
you want to consume the $1M in target advertising promoting Florida
tourism.
We need to know things like when you want to start and end, who you want
to
target, and get your opinions on the creative associated with running
the
campaign.  We need to move pretty fast as the inventory goes away
December
21.  Please contact me as soon as possible to arrange a call.

Dear Ms. Dana:

Terry Semel, our CEO, suggested that I update you on an improvement we
are
making to our proposal to rebuild the State of Florida's portal.  Yahoo!
is
responding to Governor Bush's email asking for help getting tourist's
back
to Florida.  While this was not something that was a part of the
original
scope of the relationship, we believe it is a perfect way to showcase
what
we can do together.

As part of our proposal, at no additional cost to the state, Yahoo! will
include targeted advertising promoting Florida tourism on the number one
travel site on the Internet, Yahoo! Travel.  Yahoo! Travel and Yahoo!
Lodging are the leading online portal travel sites, offering Yahoo's
200+
million users, the web's best resource to research, shop and buy travel
online. Reservation services are offered for air, car, hotel, vacations
and
cruises. Yahoo! Travel allows our partners, such as the State of
Florida, to
reach an attractive demographic, such as those engaged in research,
planning
and purchasing travel to Florida.

I hope you find this solution attractive.  We at Yahoo! want to
demonstrate
our commitment to not only delivering a great portal solution, but
leveraging the entire Yahoo! global network to solve real problems
facing
Florida today.

Please feel free to forward this to any members of your team who could
benefit from this information.  I would like to speak with you at your
earliest convenience to describe in more detail the program I have
introduced here as well as get your ideas for additional programs we
could
work on together.  Please call me or email me with any questions.

Sincerely,

Please feel free to update the governor on our progress.  If you have any
questions, do not hesitate to call me on my cell phone - 972.672.7974.  I am
staying at the Doubletree while in Tallahassee.

Friday will work fine. Doug Brisotti, copied here, is joining the team.
Doug is from our Miami office.  He will have something for you to review
Friday when we talk.  If you will have access to the internet when we speak,
Doug will be able to give you a good idea of some of the things we can do
for Florida.

The call in number is 800.430.0510  passcode 7824206.  All we need now is
the time you will be available.

sub-committee and also VP Mktg for Seaworld.   Thanks for partnering with us
in this regard.  Of course, I remain able and willing to assist at all

Pam:

Yesterday Governor Bush approved moving forward with our agreement.  That
means we will need to meet with the right people in Florida to determine how
you want to consume the $1M in target advertising promoting Florida tourism.
We need to know things like when you want to start and end, who you want to
target, and get your opinions on the creative associated with running the
campaign.  We need to move pretty fast as the inventory goes away December
21.  Please contact me as soon as possible to arrange a call.

Dear Ms. Dana:

Terry Semel, our CEO, suggested that I update you on an improvement we are
making to our proposal to rebuild the State of Florida's portal.  Yahoo! is
responding to Governor Bush's email asking for help getting tourist's back
to Florida.  While this was not something that was a part of the original
scope of the relationship, we believe it is a perfect way to showcase what
we can do together.

As part of our proposal, at no additional cost to the state, Yahoo! will
include targeted advertising promoting Florida tourism on the number one
travel site on the Internet, Yahoo! Travel.  Yahoo! Travel and Yahoo!
Lodging are the leading online portal travel sites, offering Yahoo's 200+
million users, the web's best resource to research, shop and buy travel
online. Reservation services are offered for air, car, hotel, vacations and
cruises. Yahoo! Travel allows our partners, such as the State of Florida, to
reach an attractive demographic, such as those engaged in research, planning
and purchasing travel to Florida.

I hope you find this solution attractive.  We at Yahoo! want to demonstrate
our commitment to not only delivering a great portal solution, but
leveraging the entire Yahoo! global network to solve real problems facing
Florida today.

Please feel free to forward this to any members of your team who could
benefit from this information.  I would like to speak with you at your
earliest convenience to describe in more detail the program I have
introduced here as well as get your ideas for additional programs we could
work on together.  Please call me or email me with any questions.

Sincerely,

Howard Smith

Jeb - Thanks for hosting Barbara Lumpkin and I are the Mansion for the 
holiday function - it meant a great deal to us to be there.

Governor, I'm sure you're aware the Executive Director of the Florida 
Commission on the Status of Women has been terminated - I believe unjustly 
but that's another issue for another day - and the Commission itself is in 
utter turmoil.

It's lost it's direction and purpose and almost every former chair is calling 
for it's demise before it begins to actually do damage.

It's about a quarter of a million dollars in the budget and at this point the 
only thing the Commission does of any value if the Women's Hall of Fame.

I discussed an idea with Barbara Lumpkin and she suggested I relay it to you 
for possible action.

I suggest we do away with the Commission (which there is a plan to transfer 
to your jurisdiction this budget year).  I think you can administer the 
Women's Hall of Fame in much the way the Secretary of State administers the 
Artist Recognition Program and the Art's Recognition Program - and save the 
$250,000 a year.

I think you can solicit nominations for the Hall in much the same fashion as 
the Commission - I'd then suggest involving the statewide commissions on the 
status of women and ask them to review the nominees and each of them nominate 
one and you choose your three inductees from among those nominees.

It gets the local commissions more involved and gives them a sense of purpose 
and importance.  It gives you wider discretion in who you choose or any 
governor chooses to induct.

And it continues the good tradition of the Hall of Fame, while saving Florida 
$250,000 which is sorely needed currently and is being misused by this 
Commission.

If OPAGA looked at the Commission and if the Commission were subject to the 
input and output that every other branch of your government has been - I'd 
suggest it couldn't meet the test.

Thanks Governor - I hope you'll take action before the Commission goes any 
further down the slippery slope on which it's currently headed.

I recently sent you a letter on behalf of my son who has severe autism.  He is 4 years old and desperately needs services.  We have been on a waiting list for over a year now under the medicaid waiver program and they continue to tell me there are no funds available.  I even applied under the "crisis situation" and was still told I had to wait until funds became available.  The public school has him enrolled in the program for autism but the classroom is so large, so he sits in a corner and left alone most of the time.  What a true disappointment in the school system.  This precious child is non-verbal and has not learned a thing. PLEASE!! From the bottom of my heart, I am begging for someone to HELP my son!!!! He needs one on one therapy desperately.!! I am at my wits end trying to cope!! PLEASE E-mail  me back and tell me what you can do to help us!!!

Sir please read this carefully, though I am sure you are aware of most of
it.  The part about Delmarva and Maximus is true to my belief sir.  Why
can't the districts and Support Coordinators be more responsible instead of
repeating their effort with Delmarva and Maximus.  Here in District 1 we
have started a report card system on coordinators and provider agencies
through the Family Care Council,  and the district has assured me that
individuals and agencies that are not doing their jobs correctly or
negligently will be decertified and will not be able to provide services.
To me this will be a more cost effective and cost saving way of doing thing
on a state level.  If you contact the legal department of the State of
Connecticut you will see they went to a managed care system for their
developmentally delayed children and adults and the incidence of fatalities
increased to four times the previous amount due to lack of care received
because it was deemed as not medically necessary.  Thank you again for
listening. Your friend Darrell Walker

Subject:	MINORITY-OWNED BUSINESS AWARDS NOMINATIONS 

 
Dear Friends,

 

Provider Technologies has worked very hard in Tallahassee for the past two years trying to get contracts for minority business in the Technology Field.  This week our company hosted the State Technology Office Chief of Staff "Mr. Romeo Nelson" in Tampa Bay to highlight some of Tampa Bay's premiere tech firms.  We have seen a positive change in how minorities firms participate in State contracts.  The process has reformed procurement to encourage the pursuit of diversity.  Cut the red tape in the certification process and enhanced minority business development. Doing business with the State is better than ever before and the rewards can be great.  We believe in the Governors One Florida Initiative and have supported the program throughout Tampa Bay and Florida in general.  Diversity is the way to go and "One Florida Initiative" is about Diversity.

 

Executive Order Number [EO 99-281] With my One Florida Initiative, we can increase opportunity and diversity in the states  contracting without using polices that discriminate or that pit one racial group against another.  Behind a common vision that unites us, we can ensure that the promise of Floridas future will be shared by all of Floridas residents, regardless of race, ethnicity, neighborhood, or background. Governor Jeb Bush

 

I would like all our business partners and friends to support us in the Minority-Owned Business Awards.  We are pushing for the One Florida Initiative because we know it's the right way to do business, not only in Tampa Bay but also in the whole USA. By supporting us we can continue to speak to the masses about our products and the One Florida Initiative.

 

Below is the URL to get to the nomination sheet. The dead line is December 28, 2001.   Please support us, because we support you.

 

Thank you in advance.

I've been told today that Hospital Corporation of America is having a press
conference on Monday with Elaine Chao to announce a forgiveable scholarship
program to address shortage of nurses.  

HCA would donate $5 million nationwide -- no gov money involved
Of this, HCA would dedicate $1.2 million to Florida for two areas --
Tampa/St. Pete area and South Florida
Money would be used to fund 120 scholarships for RN, LPN, Surgical and
Radiology Technicians -- AWI thinks with money they could get 	more
scholarships than 120
Scholarships are to go for displace workers as a result of Sept. 11
AWI would assist HCA with candidate screening

Tara Dudley is HCA's lobbyist and we spoke this evening -- she could not
confirm timing of announcement but was generally aware of program -- will
redouble this weekend with her client.  I told her we would be willing to do
a press release to bring some attention to this in Florida and potentially
have HCA ceo (Sen. Frist's brother) down here with you to do some kind of
media event to announce Florida scholarships over the next few weeks.

Gov. Bush,
 This Ray Smith ...AGAIN, I'm sorry to be so forward,
I'm panicking and don't know what to do. I want to be
a productive member of society and getting thrown out
on my ass is not going to help me attain that status,
I am no stupid nor am I one to this sort of thing. I
have chosen a new path Mr. Bush. I'm trying to walk in
the light of God, it is not normal for me. Dropping my
pride and saying I need help is new. 
 My landlords name is Dan Corcoran ..he's a Dade
County fire fighter...as soon as my wife left me he
started calling her asking her for "dates"...he
doesn't care if I'm in the streets. Heres a photo of
my wife and myself...I'm not a scumbag...I'm trying to
salvage this marriage...and my life. PLEASE Mr. Bush 
 My number is 305-247-4823, I apologive for the
persistance but my situation is now critical. A matter
of hours before the hammer falls. My landlords number
is 305-281-3563.....even if you could talk to him...I
doubt it would help... I'm trying like I never have.
 I would pay any funds loaned back within a matter of
months...I won't lie and say I'll have it in 2
weeks...that won't happen. Please.....I know your busy
and are probably getting really pissed off at me...I
have nowhere else to turn.

i called him/spoke with him -- not sure if there's anything we can do -- he
needs money or a pay plan with his landlord.  he has a job that he is
starting on monday, but afraid his landlord will evict him before checks
come in -- also, seems like landlord has it out for him anyway (likes his
wife).  he was appreciative of the call.  one idea -- i will call Catholic
Charities -- somebody told me they have a short term loan program -- i will
try to find out. i've also got a call into Kaplan.

I have HOPE for the future.

I want to thank you for considering my son-in-law Kevin Mawn for the recent opening.  He was, as I am, disappointed but understanding as well.  He has already pulled up his bootstraps as plans to continue working hard in his PD position for the county, the state and the people and to continue his efforts for the party via the Executive Committee. In our recent conversations, he had only positive words about the selection process, the selectee and his intention to be the best qualified candidate in the next round.

are at about the $800,000.00 mark for the donation without Zales.  123,750
pieces. (I was excited with 32,000) For the clients of the State of Florida
it is a gift from God. My managers would like to kill me.....That would be
a relief at this point.
Once again thanks for your support..... I think.

Honorable Gov Jeb Bush,

Yesterday I wrote you about a pressing need for Chrismass gifts at Fort
Campbell.

Today the 101st Airborne Division Chaplin wrote me and told me there was no
such need.

I should have written the chaplin before I wrote to you.

However, some very nice things have evolved from all this embarrasement.

Your Mrs. Doreen Rutledge demonstrated her deep and true concern for all
children and her wonderfully human manner of doing her very public job.

And I am very proud of Florida and the way she reacted to a neighbor
(supposedly) in trouble.

Thank you and I am very sorry for the confusion.

Dear Govenor Bush:


I am a board member of CIS in Okeechobee.  I met you here when you were
campaigning a few years ago.  I was impressed with your high level of
interest in improving education in the state.  As you know, Okeechobee is a
very poor county, yet we have made a difference in the lives of many
students with the various programs under the CIS umbrella. We desperately
need funding to continue our efforts.

I trust that you will veto the proposed cut in Communities in Schools
funding.  The budget has already been reduced drastically.

Thank your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Theresa Cline, SPHR

Importance: High


Pam
 
Per your request for information for Florida House.
 
The Andean region includes some of Florida's top export markets around the world.  Last year despite recessionary conditions  throughout most of the region, they still bought about 5.7 billion dollars in Florida products and probably as much as 3 billion in Florida services. Many of the products we sell them are high technology Florida origin products( see attachment # 2).  About  50% of everything Colombia buys from the US passes through Florida.
 
The Andean Trade Preference Act gives duty free entry to the US to Andean region produced products (see attachment # 1). Last year  approximately 3.3 billion dollar in Andean products passed through Florida. Thousands of Floridians are employed by the companies that import these products. For example the Colombian flower industry here employs over 10,000.
 
Repeal of the  ATPA would:
 
1- Impact heavily the already weakened economies of the region as it will affect about 35 % of the total products they export to the US. This in turn would deny them the reserves needed to buy US products affecting an already sluggish Florida export and services export.
 
2- It will damage further Florida logistic and transportation services sector that supports our two way trade not to mention the workforce that works for the importers
 
3- It will further fuel the economic pressures that are responsible for an unprecedented migration of Andean citizens to Florida, many of them undocumented.Further affecting our economy, quality of life, services, etc.
 
4- The ATPA also serves as an incentive for these nations to promote alternatives to cultivation of Coca and marijuana and to combat drug trafficking. Should the act be eliminated so will one of our key carrots to combat the drug trade.
 
I hope this helps.

These Take Stock students are given the opportunity to graduate and pursue a

Nina, 
The House approved election reform legislation last night by a vote of 362-63. The Help America Vote Act of 2001 (H.R. 3295) authorizes funding to states and counties to replace and update voting systems, and establishes mandatory election standards for states.
Federal standards under the bill would require that states do the following: 
o        Implement a statewide voter registration system linked to local jurisdictions; 
o        Permit provisional voting, or an alternative that achieves the same objective, in all precincts; 
o        Maintain and update voter registration records; 
o        Adopt uniform vote tabulation standards; 
o        Tabulate all military and overseas ballots; and 
o        Provide new voting systems for voters with disabilities. 
These standards are not optional and would apply whether or not a state received federal funding. 
Funds authorized under the bill include a one-time payment or reimbursement to states and counties of approximately $400 million to replace existing punch card voting equipment and a $2.25 billion "Election Fund" to provide payments to states over three years. States would be required to provide a 25 percent matching payment before receiving monies from the fund. The Election Fund would be administered by a bipartisan "Election Assistance Commission" comprised of state and local election officials, election experts, and other interested parties.
The Senate has not yet approved election reform legislation and is continuing with internal negotiations to develop a compromise, bipartisan reform package.

There is some talk tonight that theres less than 50-50 chance that well see an economic stimulus pkg.  If thats the case, it is imperative that the Governor speak with Chairman Young.  We understand that the Labor-H Approps bill will be voted on Wed. and DOD Approps on Thurs.  Those would be the only vehicles that could carry TANF Supp and UPL.

topics covered included marketing plan, strategic planning, and CEO contract
renewal.  

On coop partners signed up, you'll be pleased to know that VF received close
to 60 industry applications requesting to be coop partners.  Not all will
pan out as they must go through a vetting process.   AirTran was among
successful coop proposals.  $12 million at least will be match dollar for
dollar match.  They are still accepting coop proposals.

following
plan for the joint visit of Diaz Balart and Sen. Graham, and they have asked
Assistant Sec'y of Defense, Roger Pablo-Maurer to join the visit.
1)   Meet with community leaders who have been active over the years in
getting
and trying to keep Southcom in Miami.  i.e.  Lettie Bien, attny and
reservist
with Army; Donald Sleznick, formerly active with Miami Chamber of Commerce
and
currently Mayor of Coral Gables.
2) Joint site visit to Southcom.
3)  Press event.
4)  Meeting with Herald editorial board to dispel notion of the paper that
not
enough is being done to counter efforts to move Southcom.
If there is more info about this than mentioned, please let me know.  Time
of
meeting is not known yet, and the first meeting would be held close to the
Southcom location.           FYI

Miami-Dade county did opt in and adopt a 5-day waiting period that applies to gun shows. That confirms at least seven counties have opted in under the 1998 amendment: Broward, Volusia, Orange, Miami-Dade, Sarasota [informed by contact person,] Palm Beach, and Hillsborough.

Thank you for your continuing committment and leadership on behalf of substance abuse treatment and prevention. Its my understanding that you had a briefing earlier this week on substance abuse treatment and that you have directed your staff to take the measures necessary to restore funding cuts taken during special session as well as to avoid the continuation of cuts in the upcoming regular session.
We realize that these are very challenging times for you and your family and we really appreciate the fact that you continue to focus on important issues such as substance abuse.
Again, thank you.

Dear Governor; 
  
I know how busy you are in these difficult times, and I apologize, in 
advance, for disturbing you.  But I know you have said many times how 
concerned you are about kids, especially seriously ill kids. 
  
Stormy Burn is a 13 year old wheelchair bound quadriplegic.  He is now 
bedridden and in severe pain at Florida Hospital East in Orlando.  You met 
Stormy last year concerning the Medically Essential Utility Law.  He was in 
Tallahassee with the other families. 
  
Stormy's mother, Katie, pleaded with the Children's Medical Service to put a 
feeding tube in Stormy because he was not getting enough nourishment by 
mouth and he was losing weight.  Stormy was down to 61 pounds and his mother 
was afraid that his bones were going to become brittle, as they often do, 
with these children.  It took a year, and her having to sit on the floor in 
the emergency room of the hospital and threaten not to leave until they put 
the feeding tube in him.  The doctors at C.M.S. finally decided to do so. 
By this time, the child's bones have gotten so brittle, that every time they 
move him they are afraid of breaking his bones.  Are they not suppose to be 
helping these families? 
  
Stormy started to feel pain in his body and a fracture showed up on a scan 
that was done by an emergency room doctor. A cast was put on, and the doctor 
told the mother it would have to stay on for about 4 weeks.  When Mrs. Burn 
went to the Children's Medical Services Doctors at Nemourse Clinic at Arnold 
Palmer, 
she was told he did not need to keep the cast on and they removed it.  They 
strongly refused to replace the cast.  Dr. Phillips and his associate, Dr. 
Burnbaum, twisted the childs foot and leg in so many directions that they 
made him cry and yell.  Stormy has not been the same.  He was sent home in 
constant pain and was told by Bernice, the Orthopedic Nurse, that they do 
not address pain management and not to bring him in for pain. He was 
bedridden and without any medication to help relieve his pain.  His mother 
and older brother could not turn him or touch him without him crying in 
pain. They have given him an appointment in January to see an Orthopedic 
doctor.  This is ridiculous.  Stormy is presently at Florida Hospital East 
and is on heavy pain medication.  He may have a bone infection, and they 
have found a fracture in his right ankle.  He may be sent home again without 
pain medication by Dr. Goetz, another C.M.S practitioner.  Animals are 
treated better! 
  
Stormy's mother and brother have dedicated their lives to Stormy.  Their 
lives are centered upon him and his needs.  It is very frustrating to them 
and frightening not to be able to trust the doctors they need to help 
Stormy. 
  
I have had many experiences with the Children's Medical Services  over my 18 
years helping these families, and I can tell you these families are not 
treated justly.  The level of care is substandard, to say the least, with 
personnel who are nasty and vindictive and doctors who haven't a clue to a 
child's needs. 
  
Stormy needs help and he needs it now.  I know they think his mom is a big 
mouth.  But when you see your child not getting the treatment needed, and 
you have to wait a year for treatment, my patience would run out too.  More 
parents have to speak up and not be afraid of retribution.  
  
I am asking, before something else goes wrong with Stormy Burn, for your 
assistance in getting this child and other children like him assistance 
before it is too late.  This child will die if he does not get the proper 
attention. 
  
The Children's Medical Service is another example of a good idea gone bad. 
It is a waste of money and energy.  Bernice, the Orthopedic Nurse, needs to 
find another profession and so do some of the doctors Mrs. Burn has had to 
deal with. 
  
Respectfully, 
  
Tony Giorgio, President 
Compassion Children's Foundation

Nina, 
The House approved election reform legislation last night by a vote of 362-63. The Help America Vote Act of 2001 (H.R. 3295) authorizes funding to states and counties to replace and update voting systems, and establishes mandatory election standards for states.
Federal standards under the bill would require that states do the following: 
o        Implement a statewide voter registration system linked to local jurisdictions; 
o        Permit provisional voting, or an alternative that achieves the same objective, in all precincts; 
o        Maintain and update voter registration records; 
o        Adopt uniform vote tabulation standards; 
o        Tabulate all military and overseas ballots; and 
o        Provide new voting systems for voters with disabilities. 
These standards are not optional and would apply whether or not a state received federal funding. 
Funds authorized under the bill include a one-time payment or reimbursement to states and counties of approximately $400 million to replace existing punch card voting equipment and a $2.25 billion "Election Fund" to provide payments to states over three years. States would be required to provide a 25 percent matching payment before receiving monies from the fund. The Election Fund would be administered by a bipartisan "Election Assistance Commission" comprised of state and local election officials, election experts, and other interested parties.
The Senate has not yet approved election reform legislation and is continuing with internal negotiations to develop a compromise, bipartisan reform package.

Governor, we understand from the FL Hospital Association that Congressman Bilirakis may meet with Tom Scully tomorrow.  We very much want to get some background Medicaid UPL information to Congressman Bilirakis prior to his possible meeting.  It might behoove us if you send the materials directly to the Congressman.  If you have no time to call Mr. Bilirakis and tell him that the information is coming, perhaps Betty could call for you and tell his COS, Rebecca Hyder that the Governor wishes to share some background information with the Chairman.  
 
Congressman Bilirakis (and COS) number is 202/225-5755; his fax number is 202/225-4085 and Rebeccas e-mail is rebecca.hyder@mail.house.gov 
 
Attached are the three documents that should be faxed and e-mailed ASAP, and if not tonight, first thing tomorrow morning. 
 
Thanks, Nina.

I wanted to share these pictures with you. They really do not do justice to
this incredible volume and array of gifts that have been provided by
individuals, churches, RV parks, law firms, and dozens of others. Each of
our 515  kids  in foster care and protective supervision, will get multiple
presents. District staff decided to give gifts to our teenagers in
independent living. They too will get multiple presents based on their wish
list. This is just Lee county. All of our other service centers in D.8 are
doing the same thing. Just thought you'd like to know.

current update:
We have called/spoken with 
Mark Weinberger - lead negotiator with  Treasury and WH on this stimulus pkg
Mark Summerlin - lead tax/stimulus contact in WH/Larry Lindsey's shop
Karl Rove
 
Bottom line: 
1) 30% depreciation as part of corporate tax package is pretty set/wh priority - will not move at this point in time
 
2) karl met w/ 5 govs last night - said wh would quietly agree to including fmap w/a 1.5% increase for 1 year to this fed medicaid assistance - IF that is included fla could get a $162mil/GR
 
3) guidance given to govs was to get to dem govs to get daschle to bring up stimulus package for vote, if fmap in wh would sign, as long as core wh package is in it: depreciation, amt, rebates, rates (not clear on what is exactly in each of those items)>
 
4) mark summerlin - wh tax guy, said they had recently included in a redrafted admin proposal this week some type of fed unemployment insurance to offset impact of  depreciation - I specifically asked him to call me back with number WH had found out fla would get, also from what i am told NOT GR $$.
 
Nina recommends in your call to THomas you take the following approach:
 
1) CONGRATS on TANF - your hard work paid off, hope my note to fla delegation pushed some towards you....ie cliff stearns...was happy to be helpful
 
2) Need some help on Tanf sub ($60mil to fla) - should be an easy lift for him to support, we need this this year before TANF renewal debate begins next year....so we not start next year with a $60mill shortfall
 
3) move then to current debate on economic stimulus, as house ways and means chair, he is KEY player...just want him to be cognizant of impact on states/fla - is real,
        depreciation hit at 30% to fla will be approx $200m, real GR money
        just finished 2nd special session, where we cut $1.2billion
        financial hit in states is real - remember 36 govs up next year, 20 GOP govs - ....
        UPL hit to fla, and others is real - wish we could get longer transition....know your leadership got calif their 8 year transition last year.....
        ask that you NOT OPPOSE FMAP, if included in final stimulus package to offset hit we will take on depreciation item
 
    thank you for your leadership and your help - let me knw if there are others calls i can make
 
 
2nd CALL - BILL YOUNG
        He is having a celebration TONIGHT in TAMPA for his bday. - you could say happy bday!
        Ask for TANF supplemental support
        UPL - does he see this moving on either Labor H Appropriation or DOD Approps or stimulus pkg
        THANK HIM FOR HIS LEADERSHIP 
        WHAT ELSE CAN YOU DO TO HELP HIM
 
Let's discuss
Timing of calls VERY VERY IMPORTANT

Team, 
 
We need to fish or cut bait.  All signs are that Congress will work up to Friday, cut whatever deals they can between now and the weekend and return one day next week to pass that which is agreed to.
 
There are a few open issueswe need guidance from you on priorities and we likely need one phone call from the Governor to Chairman Young------ its now or wait till next year.
 
Today, the NGA Executive Committee met with Governors Whitman, Ridge, Secretary Thompson and Director Brown (Allbaughs Deputy).  11 Governors attended:  Minner (D-ME), Sundquist (R-TN), Musgrove (D-MS), Leavitt (R-UT), Engler (R-MI), Patton (D-KY), Huckabee (R-AR), Vilsack (D-IA), Kempthorne (R-ID), Glendenning (D-MD), OBannon (D-IN).  Some of their comments are reflected below. 
 
UPL---- According to our hospital contacts 18 of our FL House Members and both Senators have co-sponsored legislation delaying UPL rule for 1 year.  Im thinking I need to go to Mr. Bilirakis and ask him how to bring this to a close.  Overall, the bill has 60 co-sponsors.  This issue needs a bit of a push.  If I go see Mr. B, it will be read as a message from the Gov.  We have been holding off on flying above radar because we have not received approval on our last plan amendment.  If were too vocal, were concerned that the Administration will not grant or delay granting our plan amendment.  This issue is $185M to the pocketbook.
 
Economic Stimulus----according to NGA, the Senate has now moved to the House column on depreciation allowance.   That means that both House and Senate agreed to a 30% depreciation allowance; this means a revenue loss to Florida of $200 million.  The NGA including Governors Engler, Pataki, and Sundquist were on the Hill yesterday and today pushing FMAP.  NGAs Democrat Govs met with 14 Senate Democrats (including Daschle) and assured NGA that the Senate Democrats are committed to FMAP.  The question was raised as to how we approach the WH (Engler looked at my direction, I stared at the floor).  All Govs acknowledged that the WH was the stumbling block.  FMAP could mean $162M to $324M to FL.
 
TANF Supplemental Grants----on a scale of 1 to 10(passage); we feel this is at 8.  We need to push Chairman Thomas.  At todays NGA Executive Committee meeting, Governor Sundquist announced that he has again called Chairman Thomas.  Doesnt know whether it was effective.  The Senate passed a stand alone bill which the House could consider under suspension (stand alone, without Committee action).  Were hoping but not convinced.  This issue means $60M to FL. 
 
Seaport Security----we have conveyed to Chairman Young a short list of earmarks for Defense Approps.  I received assurances from Youngs COS that if they cant specifically earmark out of the Supplemental bill they would try to include in separate categories within DOD approps.  Commissioner Moore insists that this issue is Govs number 1.  He would like the Gov to call Chairman Young and make this happen.  At the NGA meeting, Governor Ridge expressed his views on the supplementalhe essentially said its out of his hands, and anyone elses.  He suggested to the Governors that they focus their attention on the Presidents 03 Budget.  I conveyed Governor Ridges remarks to Com Moore and it was not to his satisfaction.  He has asked me whether he should come up to see Chairman Young (even if the Governor should call the Chairman).  This earmark is for $30M.
 
CONCLUSION: We need to determine our priorities.  At the end of this game, there may well be only one pot of money, one vehicle.  This requires us to be very focused on any message to the Hill.  We have one shot at the pot and every hour that goes by means less opportunity.  Can we conference in the morning?  We need to know whether I pay a few visits to the Hill and whether the Governor makes a call to Chairman Young.

Spoke to Marc Summerlin -- the redrafted proposal would provide Florida with $237 million from Reed Act funds.  This is money that would go primarily (90%) into our UC Trust Fund for benefits, etc. NONE OF THIS COULD BE USED TO OFFSET GR LOSSES ON OTHER SIDE OF THE LEDGER.  Some states have general revenue supplements or payments into their UC funds -- if that was the case we could of used this new revenue to offset.  Unfortunately, Florida is one of the few states that has zero gr supplements or payments into its UC fund.
 
Still, this money could be used for Operation Paycheck activities and other reemployment services -- it just doesnt help our immediate budget problem.

current update:
We have called/spoken with 
Mark Weinberger - lead negotiator with  Treasury and WH on this stimulus pkg
Mark Summerlin - lead tax/stimulus contact in WH/Larry Lindsey's shop
Karl Rove
 
Bottom line: 
1) 30% depreciation as part of corporate tax package is pretty set/wh priority - will not move at this point in time
 
2) karl met w/ 5 govs last night - said wh would quietly agree to including fmap w/a 1.5% increase for 1 year to this fed medicaid assistance - IF that is included fla could get a $162mil/GR
 
3) guidance given to govs was to get to dem govs to get daschle to bring up stimulus package for vote, if fmap in wh would sign, as long as core wh package is in it: depreciation, amt, rebates, rates (not clear on what is exactly in each of those items)>
 
4) mark summerlin - wh tax guy, said they had recently included in a redrafted admin proposal this week some type of fed unemployment insurance to offset impact of  depreciation - I specifically asked him to call me back with number WH had found out fla would get, also from what i am told NOT GR $$.
 
Nina recommends in your call to THomas you take the following approach:
 
1) CONGRATS on TANF - your hard work paid off, hope my note to fla delegation pushed some towards you....ie cliff stearns...was happy to be helpful
 
2) Need some help on Tanf sub ($60mil to fla) - should be an easy lift for him to support, we need this this year before TANF renewal debate begins next year....so we not start next year with a $60mill shortfall
 
3) move then to current debate on economic stimulus, as house ways and means chair, he is KEY player...just want him to be cognizant of impact on states/fla - is real,
        depreciation hit at 30% to fla will be approx $200m, real GR money
        just finished 2nd special session, where we cut $1.2billion
        financial hit in states is real - remember 36 govs up next year, 20 GOP govs - ....
        UPL hit to fla, and others is real - wish we could get longer transition....know your leadership got calif their 8 year transition last year.....
        ask that you NOT OPPOSE FMAP, if included in final stimulus package to offset hit we will take on depreciation item
 
    thank you for your leadership and your help - let me knw if there are others calls i can make
 
 
2nd CALL - BILL YOUNG
        He is having a celebration TONIGHT in TAMPA for his bday. - you could say happy bday!
        Ask for TANF supplemental support
        UPL - does he see this moving on either Labor H Appropriation or DOD Approps or stimulus pkg

Team, 
 
We need to fish or cut bait.  All signs are that Congress will work up to Friday, cut whatever deals they can between now and the weekend and return one day next week to pass that which is agreed to.
 
There are a few open issueswe need guidance from you on priorities and we likely need one phone call from the Governor to Chairman Young------ its now or wait till next year.
 
Today, the NGA Executive Committee met with Governors Whitman, Ridge, Secretary Thompson and Director Brown (Allbaughs Deputy).  11 Governors attended:  Minner (D-ME), Sundquist (R-TN), Musgrove (D-MS), Leavitt (R-UT), Engler (R-MI), Patton (D-KY), Huckabee (R-AR), Vilsack (D-IA), Kempthorne (R-ID), Glendenning (D-MD), OBannon (D-IN).  Some of their comments are reflected below. 
 
UPL---- According to our hospital contacts 18 of our FL House Members and both Senators have co-sponsored legislation delaying UPL rule for 1 year.  Im thinking I need to go to Mr. Bilirakis and ask him how to bring this to a close.  Overall, the bill has 60 co-sponsors.  This issue needs a bit of a push.  If I go see Mr. B, it will be read as a message from the Gov.  We have been holding off on flying above radar because we have not received approval on our last plan amendment.  If were too vocal, were concerned that the Administration will not grant or delay granting our plan amendment.  This issue is $185M to the pocketbook.
 
Economic Stimulus----according to NGA, the Senate has now moved to the House column on depreciation allowance.   That means that both House and Senate agreed to a 30% depreciation allowance; this means a revenue loss to Florida of $200 million.  The NGA including Governors Engler, Pataki, and Sundquist were on the Hill yesterday and today pushing FMAP.  NGAs Democrat Govs met with 14 Senate Democrats (including Daschle) and assured NGA that the Senate Democrats are committed to FMAP.  The question was raised as to how we approach the WH (Engler looked at my direction, I stared at the floor).  All Govs acknowledged that the WH was the stumbling block.  FMAP could mean $162M to $324M to FL.
 
TANF Supplemental Grants----on a scale of 1 to 10(passage); we feel this is at 8.  We need to push Chairman Thomas.  At todays NGA Executive Committee meeting, Governor Sundquist announced that he has again called Chairman Thomas.  Doesnt know whether it was effective.  The Senate passed a stand alone bill which the House could consider under suspension (stand alone, without Committee action).  Were hoping but not convinced.  This issue means $60M to FL. 
 
Seaport Security----we have conveyed to Chairman Young a short list of earmarks for Defense Approps.

Just to let everyone know that the legislature, despite all the funding cuts
and such, actually gave the STO's Office of Information Security an
additional $500,000 to expand the information security audits of State
agencies.  the sponsor was Sen. Ginny Brown-Waite, the chair of the Senate
Security Committee.  This action tells me the legislature wants information
security to continue and if we move forward to make this a continuation
issue, we will receive favorable consideration from the legislature.

Team, 
 
We need to fish or cut bait.  All signs are that Congress will work up to Friday, cut whatever deals they can between now and the weekend and return one day next week to pass that which is agreed to.
 
There are a few open issueswe need guidance from you on priorities and we likely need one phone call from the Governor to Chairman Young------ its now or wait till next year.

Lauren,

	Thanks for the invitation.  I fear that, if university 
presidents attend this, we may get the question of whether the 
flexibility bill helps our situation and, the truth is, it does not. 
If it helps school districts, I am very supportive but I do not think

Hello, 
A quick update on ESEA, and dollars to Florida: 
The ESEA Re-authorization Conference Report is scheduled to go to the floor of the House for a final vote on Thursday, and is yet unscheduled in the Senate. 
According to the Congressional Research Service a dollar estimate for ESEA Title I, Part A "Grants to States" for Florida is approximately $510 million.
As soon as the ESEA Conference Report is passed by the House and Senate, the Labor/HHS/Education Appropriation bill should begin to move in chambers, which will give us a more exact number.

Kevin, it was good talking with you yesterday.  I ahve been out for 2 days,
trying to get over this damn bronchitis! And this fog has been REAL
helpful...

Your response to Lisa's requests is correct.  There is ZERO duplication in
funds vis a vis FDLE.  They received no cyberterrorism funding; in fact,
they are counting on STO to push that initiative.  The training dollars in
the FIPC proposal are for local governments, and members of the critical
infrastructure, to learn about the alert software.

Everything we have presented has been vetted by FDLE and fits into their
grand scheme of things.  They just don't have funds, and neither does the
Federal Government.  I asked the President's cyber guy, Richard Clarke, that
very questions and got the "no, there's no cash" response.  In fact, Clarke
asked Bob Breeden and I to write the state government component of what he
wants to do!
If we are serious about combatting all forms of terrorism -- including
cyberterrorism -- then these initiatives will find their way into the
Governor's recs.  I will close with the observation from the recent NASCIO
meeting Kim and I attended that no other state in the Union is moving
forward with such detailed plans.  Kansas, Virginia and Arizona are trying
to implement, but Florida is far ahead of the other states in both critical
infrastrcture defense plans, and in cyberterrorism defense.

If anyone needs me, I am at 488-7241 and ready to help anyway I can.

Subject: RE: Budget Issues: Security Reductions


Lisa - I am trying to get in touch w/Scott to verify, but here are the
answers based on my understanding at this time:

1.  To continue the True Secure Audits, $1,250,000 is needed.  This would
provide for expansion of the security audits to non-Governor agencies.

2.  A)  Per discussion w/Bob Breeden, Special Agent at FDLE (Ph. 410.7057)
who has worked closely w/Scott on security issues, none of the amounts
requested in the Office of Info. Security Issue or the FIPC Issue are
duplicative of what was funded in FDLE during special session.  B)  Funding
received by FDLE during special session was not related to computer forensic
assistance.

3.  The $1.25 million provides for expansion of the security audits to
non-Governor agencies.  These audits involve the following:

	Attempt to penetrate core systems, data centers, and networks
	Scan all ports for potential security breaches
	Map existing data networks to determine points of weakness
	Place all CIOs and InfoSec officers on their exclusive TruSecure
alert system
	Generate detailed reports for the agency to examine and evaluate
	Work with the agency to remediate and close loopholes in their
computer security
	Retest the entity to determine the quality of their remediation
effort
	Certify the entity once the remediation has been proven successful

4.  The $961,300 is broken down as follows:

- $386,300 for software.  The specific software to be used in the FIPC Issue
has not yet been identified.  The desired software would provide for mass
notification of attacks on Florida's infrastructure (i.e., telephone, gas,
banks, etc.) through e-mail mesaages, beeper alerts, etc.  Software to
perform these functions is available and would be acquired through a
competitive procurement process.  

- $575,000 for a contract with TrueSecure.  This would provide Florida with
access to what TrueSecure calls "The Brain".  The Brain is essentially a
massive intelligence tool.  Florida would also get access to TrueSecure
resources such as one of their groups that infiltrates hackers and warns
companies like McAfee and Norton of new viruses.  

5.  That would be another option.  Your call given the fiscal situation.

6.  Per discussion w/Bob Breeden, Special Agent at FDLE (Ph. 410.7057), FDLE
did not receive an additional appropriation for cyber terrorism.

7.  See attachments for additional info. Last page has some spending plan
info., but it is not much more detailed.  The narrative may be helpful.

Kevin,

First, I apologize for not reading the issue narrative ahead of time.
Second, there is not enough detail to ascertain whether this issues are
absolutely essential.  The bar has been raised very high on new issues given
the current fiscal situation. Here are some questions I have:

1.  What level of funding is needed to continue the True Secure contract?
2.  Is any of this issue duplicative with what was funded in FDLE during
special session?  Specifically, why does FDLE need computer forensic
assistance if their issue was just fund?
3.  What exactly do you get for $1.25 million security audits and alerts?
4.  What software?  What do you get for the $?  What are the licenses?  So
you are buying a data base for $961,300?
5.  Shouldn't training for agency staff be requested by the agency where a
multitude of other funds could be used?
6.  Did FDLE receive additional appropriation for cyber terrorism?
7.  Do you have a more detailed spending plan?

Sorry for the delay.  Any information you get us will be a tremendous help.

Scott - The Governor has not yet made a decision on whether to include the
two security issues (i.e., Office of Info. Security and FIPC) in the Gov.
Rec's.  That decision may be made today.  As I mentioned to you yesterday at
lunch, OPB has requested that the funding requests for the two issues be
reduced.  At this time, the following reductions have been made:

Deletions in Office of Information Security Issue

Training						   75,000

Deletions in FIPC Issue

Importance: High


Team, 
 
We need to fish or cut bait.  All signs are that Congress will work up to Friday, cut whatever deals they can between now and the weekend and return one day next week to pass that which is agreed to.
 
There are a few open issueswe need guidance from you on priorities and we likely need one phone call from the Governor to Chairman Young------ its now or wait till next year.
 
Today, the NGA Executive Committee met with Governors Whitman, Ridge, Secretary Thompson and Director Brown (Allbaughs Deputy).  11 Governors attended:  Minner (D-ME), Sundquist (R-TN), Musgrove (D-MS), Leavitt (R-UT), Engler (R-MI), Patton (D-KY), Huckabee (R-AR), Vilsack (D-IA), Kempthorne (R-ID), Glendenning (D-MD), OBannon (D-IN).  Some of their comments are reflected below. 
 
UPL---- According to our hospital contacts 18 of our FL House Members and both Senators have co-sponsored legislation delaying UPL rule for 1 year.  Im thinking I need to go to Mr. Bilirakis and ask him how to bring this to a close.  Overall, the bill has 60 co-sponsors.  This issue needs a bit of a push.  If I go see Mr. B, it will be read as a message from the Gov.  We have been holding off on flying above radar because we have not received approval on our last plan amendment.  If were too vocal, were concerned that the Administration will not grant or delay granting our plan amendment.  This issue is $185M to the pocketbook.
 
Economic Stimulus----according to NGA, the Senate has now moved to the House column on depreciation allowance.   That means that both House and Senate agreed to a 30% depreciation allowance; this means a revenue loss to Florida of $200 million.  The NGA including Governors Engler, Pataki, and Sundquist were on the Hill yesterday and today pushing FMAP.  NGAs Democrat Govs met with 14 Senate Democrats (including Daschle) and assured NGA that the Senate Democrats are committed to FMAP.  The question was raised as to how we approach the WH (Engler looked at my direction, I stared at the floor).  All Govs acknowledged that the WH was the stumbling block.  FMAP could mean $162M to $324M to FL.
 
TANF Supplemental Grants----on a scale of 1 to 10(passage); we feel this is at 8.  We need to push Chairman Thomas.  At todays NGA Executive Committee meeting, Governor Sundquist announced that he has again called Chairman Thomas.  Doesnt know whether it was effective.  The Senate passed a stand alone bill which the House could consider under suspension (stand alone, without Committee action).  Were hoping but not convinced.  This issue means $60M to FL. 
 
Seaport Security----we have conveyed to Chairman Young a short list of earmarks for Defense Approps.  I received assurances from Youngs COS that if they cant specifically earmark out of the Supplemental bill they would try to include in separate categories within DOD approps.  Commissioner Moore insists that this issue is Govs number 1.  He would like the Gov to call Chairman Young and make this happen.  At the NGA meeting, Governor Ridge expressed his views on the supplementalhe essentially said its out of his hands, and anyone elses.  He suggested to the Governors that they focus their attention on the Presidents 03 Budget.  I conveyed Governor Ridges remarks to Com Moore and it was not to his satisfaction.  He has asked me whether he should come up to see Chairman Young (even if the Governor should call the Chairman).  This earmark is for $30M.
 
CONCLUSION: We need to determine our priorities.  At the end of this game, there may well be only one pot of money, one vehicle.  This requires us to be very focused on any message to the Hill.  We have one shot at the pot and every hour that goes by means less opportunity.  Can we conference in the morning?  We need to know whether I pay a few visits to the Hill and whether the Governor makes a call to Chairman Young.
 
Thank, Nina.

Hi Jeb...We voted for YOU!


Subject:  Brevard County Shore Protection Project Funding: Phase II, South Reach

Dear Senator:

I request your leadership in obtaining federal funds for Brevard County's beaches in the 2001 Conference Energy and Water Bill.  The House bill included $8.5 million for Brevard County's Shore Protection Project, but the Senate and Administration's budgets included only $200,000.  The federal cost-share for Phase II, as authorized by Congress in 1996, is $12 million.  Brevard County needs this $12 million appropriated in the FY 2001-2002 Conference Bill.  Brevard County is relying on you to take the lead in appropriating these dollars.

A few special interest groups have attempted to label beach nourishment as pork, primarily benefiting wealthy oceanfront property owners.  This is untrue!  As the photos above indicate, the majority of those who benefit are the millions of people who relax and play on our public beaches each year.  Private property rights in America give oceanfront property owners the right to protect their investments or to be compensated by the government for lost property.  When faced with erosion, these property owners erect seawalls.  Seawalls displace public recreation, increase the pace of erosion, and destroy marine turtle nesting habitat.  Along highly developed shorelines like Brevard's, the government simply cannot afford to outlaw seawalls and fund a retreat policy.  In contrast, beach nourishment restores the beaches to a healthy width, thereby averting the demand for seawalls while simultaneously creating huge recreational and environmental benefits.  Beach nourishment saves America's beaches from seawalls.

Thank you in advance for your support.  With a $12 million appropriation in the Conference Bill, we can build back Brevard's beaches.

Hello, Governor. 

We have a list of celebrity Floridians and their contact information
(agents). You may have other ideas and we welcome your input in
prioritizing
the order in which they are contacted. Our goal is to confirm 6
celebrities
for the first wave. This number may change a bit depending on the needs
identified as we complete the evaluation of all the recovery co-op
proposals
over the next few days.

As you may recall, we have several existing concepts and can quickly
script
additional ideas if we end up working with other celebrities. Since we
are
hopeful the celebrities will essentially donate their time, your call
would
be very helpful. (We may be required to pay minimum scale to avoid
difficulties with the artists' unions since these are intended to run as
paid commercials.) I'll forward the list to you and Pam upon my return
to
Tampa. 

I'll be in Tallahassee Monday, December 17 at the request of Rep. Randy
Johnson's committee. If you'd like and your schedule permits, perhaps we
could spend a few minutes finalizing the list and addressing any
questions
you have.

I also spoke with Pam here in Naples regarding the out-of-state radio
commercials we'd like you to record. Pam indicated she will be checking
your
availability for a recording session and we will be forwarding updated
scripts for your approval.

Thank you very much for your interest and support.

Thanks Scott. I'll see what I can do on the taping effort and celebs
narrowing.  I have asked several times for an update on coops from
Austin--per request of Governor.  I've got nothing yet.  I very much
look
forward to an update for our Gov.

Things are moving forward rapidly. I'd like to catch up with you for a
few
minutes regarding scheduling the Governor for the recording of the radio
commercials and narrowing our list of celebrities for the in-state
campaign.
Are you going to be in Naples for the Commission meetings? If not, I'll
try
to give you a call during the course of the meetings. I'll also have my
cell
at 813-361-7536.

We're excited about where we are on co-op and are currently finalizing a
range of proposals including airlines, lodging, rental car companies,
CVBs,
tour operators, attractions, independents, etc. Large and small. Austin
is
putting together a more formal update.

Talk to you soon.

Thanks.

Importance:	High

Team, 
 
We need to fish or cut bait.  All signs are that Congress will work up to Friday, cut whatever deals they can between now and the weekend and return one day next week to pass that which is agreed to.
 
There are a few open issueswe need guidance from you on priorities and we likely need one phone call from the Governor to Chairman Young------ its now or wait till next year.
 
Today, the NGA Executive Committee met with Governors Whitman, Ridge, Secretary Thompson and Director Brown (Allbaughs Deputy).  11 Governors attended:  Minner (D-ME), Sundquist (R-TN), Musgrove (D-MS), Leavitt (R-UT), Engler (R-MI), Patton (D-KY), Huckabee (R-AR), Vilsack (D-IA), Kempthorne (R-ID), Glendenning (D-MD), OBannon (D-IN).  Some of their comments are reflected below. 
 
UPL---- According to our hospital contacts 18 of our FL House Members and both Senators have co-sponsored legislation delaying UPL rule for 1 year.  Im thinking I need to go to Mr. Bilirakis and ask him how to bring this to a close.  Overall, the bill has 60 co-sponsors.  This issue needs a bit of a push.  If I go see Mr. B, it will be read as a message from the Gov.  We have been holding off on flying above radar because we have not received approval on our last plan amendment.  If were too vocal, were concerned that the Administration will not grant or delay granting our plan amendment.  This issue is $185M to the pocketbook.
 
Economic Stimulus----according to NGA, the Senate has now moved to the House column on depreciation allowance.   That means that both House and Senate agreed to a 30% depreciation allowance; this means a revenue loss to Florida of $200 million.  The NGA including Governors Engler, Pataki, and Sundquist were on the Hill yesterday and today pushing FMAP.  NGAs Democrat Govs met with 14 Senate Democrats (including Daschle) and assured NGA that the Senate Democrats are committed to FMAP.  The question was raised as to how we approach the WH (Engler looked at my direction, I stared at the floor).  All Govs acknowledged that the WH was the stumbling block.  FMAP could mean $162M to $324M to FL.
 
TANF Supplemental Grants----on a scale of 1 to 10(passage); we feel this is at 8.  We need to push Chairman Thomas.  At todays NGA Executive Committee meeting, Governor Sundquist announced that he has again called Chairman Thomas.  Doesnt know whether it was effective.  The Senate passed a stand alone bill which the House could consider under suspension (stand alone, without Committee action).  Were hoping but not convinced.  This issue means $60M to FL. 
 
Seaport Security----we have conveyed to Chairman Young a short list of earmarks for Defense Approps.  I received assurances from Youngs COS that if they cant specifically earmark out of the Supplemental bill they would try to include in separate categories within DOD approps.  Commissioner Moore insists that this issue is Govs number 1.  He would like the Gov to call Chairman Young and make this happen.  At the NGA meeting, Governor Ridge expressed his views on the supplementalhe essentially said its out of his hands, and anyone elses.  He suggested to the Governors that they focus their attention on the Presidents 03 Budget.  I conveyed Governor Ridges remarks to Com Moore and it was not to his satisfaction.  He has asked me whether he should come up to see Chairman Young (even if the Governor should call the Chairman).  This earmark is for $30M.
 
CONCLUSION: We need to determine our priorities.  At the end of this game, there may well be only one pot of money, one vehicle.  This requires us to be very focused on any message to the Hill.  We have one shot at the pot and every hour that goes by means less opportunity.  Can we conference in the morning?  We need to know whether I pay a few visits to the Hill and whether the Governor makes a call to Chairman Young.
 
Thank, Nina.

Brian, as soon as I walked in my office this morning I had a group of avocado and tropical fruit growers (all Cuban-Americans) in a conference call. They are upset because the governor persuaded a number of Florida delegation members to vote for TPA. But they had also heard that the governor had written a letter to President Bush urging more Mexican product, including avocados enter the U.S. Market. I denied that such letter existed, at least to my knowledge. 

In summary, they are pissed. And obviously the rumors are a dime a dozen. It is important that we proceed with our wish list to the W. H.,  as well as in some form or other the farm community needs to learn that Governor Bush, although a free trader, supports Florida farmers above all. 

Thanks 

Jose Luis

The Secretary was here all day today reviewing the sector plan around the airport. He did a wonderful job and represented you well. He spoke at a luncheon with about 80 people consisting of elected officials (local and state and representatives of Congressman Boyd and Sen. Nelson), developers, environmentalists and local leaders. All responded very positively to him and his message. I think we overwhelmed him with the sector plan - we've got over 30,000 acres of conservation around the perimeter of West Bay. I'll send you a map sometime so you can gawk over it. William

like to know if in the next few days if you would have 2 minutes to
spare so I may deliver both books to you.  If you are not available, I

Subject: Rumor Mill


Brian, as soon as I walked in my office this morning I had a group of avocado and tropical fruit growers (all Cuban-Americans) in a conference call. They are upset because the governor persuaded a number of Florida delegation members to vote for TPA. But they had also heard that the governor had written a letter to President Bush urging more Mexican product, including avocados enter the U.S. Market. I denied that such letter existed, at least to my knowledge. 

In summary, they are pissed. And obviously the rumors are a dime a dozen. It is important that we proceed with our wish list to the W. H.,  as well as in some form or other the farm community needs to learn that Governor Bush, although a free trader, supports Florida farmers above all. 

Thanks

Area has stake in board vacancy 



Drought and concerns about phosphate mining place added significance on the task of filling a vacant seat on the Peace River Basin Board. 


Punta Gorda resident Tom D'Andrea unexpectedly resigned his position on the board recently and care must be taken to appoint someone who not only has knowledge of Southwest Florida's water resources but someone who can commit to standing up for our best interests. 


D'Andrea's resignation came shortly after Don Ross -- Charlotte County's second, and only other, delegate -- moved from the county and was forced to step down. Ross was replaced by former Punta Gorda Mayor Rufus Lazell. 


The board plays an important role in shaping water-related policy in Southwest Florida. The six-pers! on board is charged with investigating issues regarding water in the five-county basin and recommending solutions and policy to the Southwest Florida Water Management District, also known as SWIFTMUD. 


In recent months, sentiments on the board have swung from one extreme to the next as representatives from inland counties sought to protect their water resources from being diverted to fast-growing coastal counties. Board members from Polk and DeSoto counties have also voiced support for phosphate mining -- an industry they are relying on for economic development. 


Charlotte County has sometimes stood alone in its battle to force more extensive studies of the effects of phosphate mining on the Peace River, which provides drinking water to Charlotte County, North Port and eventually Sarasota County. 


The fact Charlotte County is the lone government with two representatives speaks of its size and the underdog role its board members embrace. Their greatest chal! lenge is to convince representatives of smaller, inland counties to be more proactive in protecting the few water resources we have while planning for alternative sources. 


D'Andrea was an outspoken proponent of protecting the Peace River and Horse Creek. His voice on the board will be missed. 


The process of nominating a replacement is a wide-open affair. While no names have surfaced publicly, it would benefit all coastal communities if local politicos and Charlotte County officials work together to support a qualified, dedicated nominee. 


Even though all Peace River Basin recommendations must be approved by SWIFTMUD, the importance of coming up with fact-based, responsible policies cannot be stressed enough. Charlotte County's next representative will shoulder an important responsibility We must seek out a quality nominee.

FBI: Uncorroborated threat received against Texas schools 

12/12/2001 

By CONNIE MABIN / The Associated Press 

AUSTIN - FBI agents have alerted schools throughout Texas that a vague threat has been received suggesting two people may retaliate against unknown Texas schools for the U.S. bombing in Afghanistan.

"Basically, as vague as I gave it, is as vague as we have it," Houston FBI Special Agent Bob Doguim said Wednesday. "This is coming to us from a foreign government. We are working with them to try and determine the reliability of it."

GOVERNOR

I am so sorry again to bother you with this matter. I would be sending this instead to Mr Agwunobi but he has never been kind enough to give me his e-mail address. 

I have written Kimberly Hatten and Patrick Forand of the Division of Health Awareness and Tobacco and told them they ought to be ashamed of themselves for not taking care of picking this laptop computer up 6 weeks ago and making you and the Director of Health get involved. Unfortunately I am sorry to say, the local SWAT coordinator, Stephen Livesay's attempts today were of such a threatening nature, telling me he had to come with someone as a witness, to meet with my just turned 16 year old son,  was just too much. I refuse to be threatened, I am so sick from this I am on the verge of being hospitalized, but I promise, I will pay someone to have the laptop shipped and insured to you at my expense within the next two days. I will send you a tracking number but I don't want anyone coming to my house threatening me they that have to bring a witness to meet my minor son. I am a retired deputy sheriff in this state (and Bob Butterworth knows me well) for 25 years who was disabled in the line of duty. We are not a threat to anyone. How dare he suggest he needs a witness and my son be left alone because I cannot accompany him. You will have your laptop personally and tracking numbers via e-mail within 2 days, I promise.

Subject:	Farm Share

Governor I have spoken with Patricia Robbins of Farm Share and with Joan Glickman in Senator Jones' office regarding the Farm Share funding.  Both were comfortable with the fact that the $900,000 would be non-recurring and that they would be at square one during the next legislative session.  According to Patricia Robbins, they were already going to ask for additional money next year, over the $400,000 recurring, and expected to be funded out of non-recurring anyway.  Senator Jones is preparing the paperwork now for next years request.  The additional money they will receive this year will enable them to distribute an additional 15 million pounds of food from USDA giving them a total distribution of 31.2 million pounds of food this year.  So it would be my recommendation to leave the funding in the special session alone and let them come back to the legislature for funding next year.

Letters to the Editor
Florida Today
P.O. Box 419000
Melbourne, FL 32941-9000

Your November 29 article, "Gov. Bush denies Brevard and Indian River
counties money to renourish beaches," misconstrued the process for
requesting federal disaster assistance and failed to mention any of the
measures we are taking to protect these vital Florida assets.

Simply put, it was not my decision to deny funding.  I was unable to request
a federal disaster declaration because one can only be issued within certain
strict guidelines.  One of these is that the impact of every storm must be
individually assessed by teams of local and state officials to determine if
the damages rise to the level of a federal disaster. In the case of
Hurricane Michelle, what damage could be documented did not reach this
level.

Your paper performed a disservice by not making these guidelines clear.  In
Florida, our focus has been, and will continue to be, on protecting and
strengthening our beaches so that beach erosion-whether gradual or
catastrophic-can be prevented.

To that end, we have brought together a team of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, Federal Highway Administration, U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers and our Congressional delegation to find both short- and long-term
solutions to fix our beaches and to minimize further erosion.

I have full confidence in the team we have assembled to protect Florida's
beaches in their pristine beauty.



Sincerely,



Jeb Bush

Subject:	Biotechnology Initiative

Chief,

Just to bring you up to speed on what we are doing to further your interest
in developing a tool to expand the state's biotechnology sector, I have put
together a basic outline of our OTTED strategy.

Bio-Tech Initiative:

I.  Identify key members of the state's existing bio-tech infrastructure.
	(Because it is impossible for me or other state government types to
know the finer points related to biotechnology or the 	economic strategies
that may be in place in other states to help develop the industry, I have
chosen some of Florida's leaders 	in the field to make up an informal
panel for reviewing and suggesting ideas and strategies.)

	The selected members are the following (This list will continue to
be expanded over the next few days to include medical
device manufacturers):

	a.  Scott Adams, Cenetec
	b.  David Day, University of Florida
	c.  John Fraser, Florida State University
	d.  Weaver Gaines, Ixion Biotechnology and Chair of Bio-Florida
	e.  David Gury, Nabi
	f.   Gary Hennen, Oglesby-Plants International
	g.  Albert Kern, Entomos
	h.  Jeff Kline, Accris
	i.   Win Philips, University of Florida
	j.   John Rogers, AquaGene
	k.  Bob Zahradinik, OraGen

II.  Provide a set of principles to help in analyzing possible state
strategies.
	(I will provide each of the informal panelists a list of seven
principles to assist them in "grading" programs that other states 	may
have in place and may be replicated here in Florida.)

III.  Provide a list of programs that have been effective in other states
that have a current biotechnology strategy.
	(That list is made up from a couple of comparative studies that I
have found which outlines what each state is doing as it 	relates to
the field of biotechnology.)

IV. Get feedback in the form of grading sheets on the programs being
utilized in other states.

V.  Group and segregate suggestions that are original ideas and unrelated to
other states' programs.

VI.  Formulate a final strategy for presentation to the Governor with fiscal
impact analysis from OPB.


Chief, this is the outline of the plan that we are pursuing.  Our panel will
all have seen the material that I am mailing to them by Friday of this week.
I have a couple of other ideas.  We have received initial agreement through
David Day at UF to have former Governor Jim Hunt of North Carolina come down
here and have a discussion with us and possibly even you to explain the
steps that they took in North Carolina to make that state a leader in
biotechnology.  That could possibly be a public event.  Also, ITFlorida.Com
and the Florida Research Consortium will be doing the first ever legislative
"Tech Days" in Tallahassee on the tentative dates of January 29th and 30th.
It may very well be a great forum after working through this exercise to
target one of those days to publicly unveil a Bio-Tech Initiative along with
those respective boards.

Do you have any questions on any of the cases that would require a little
research on my part before our meeting in the morning?  If not, I'll see you
at 8.  

I do have 2 updates:

1.	Michael Lue #14.  The child support matter has been resolved by
court order.  He no longer has an arrearage.
			   He has received a notice to appear before an INS
judge on Jan. 11, 2002, regarding removal proceedings.

2.	Joseph Reilly #38  Although I recommended a grant, I had a concern
that he continued to drive even though his license had
been revoked.  I learned today that the 1-16-98 entry on his traffic record
was a marine violation for not 				    having the
proper number of life jackets on his boat.  So there is no indication that
he's been driving a car 				    since his
conviction.

Hi Brian - we have reviewed our admissions process and think we will guarantee admissions to the top 5 percent of graduates at all public high schools in Florida. How does this strike you? My best, David
 
P.S. Incidentally, we are adding Orlando Jones and Orlando Evans to our partnership with Raines, Ribault, and Miami Senior High. We will provide scholarships to the top 5 graduates of each of these schools and also work with the teachers on providing academic enrichment programs for them and their students. Stay well

I went FRS-ing this morning...Gallagher totally agrees with the new methodology...Coburn was clearly intrigued. 

I also talked to David C about the doc stamps piece on everglades (I have a new spreadsheet for you); I did not mention the other part.  He said the house is working on something similar, so he will be thrilled when we tell him about the other part.  I went through the spreadsheet with Struhs yesterday after agency heads.  Frank J told us you would be taping remarks for the Jan 4 event where you could announce.  David S is working on who and when to brief.

Hi Liz.
Here is the shortened version of the oped.
I have spoken already to Joe Oglesby and they said they can probably run it
full. It is only slightly over their 700 word count. I have also asked him
to let us have a chance to trim -- and he's OK with that.

He does need to have it no later than tomorrow at noon for it to have a
chance for Sunday publication. I asked him to give us that Sunday spot
since his piece ran on Sunday. He agreed that he should try to make that
happen.

We're now waiting on you and the response from EOG.

Thanks very much.
LaNedra

Subject:	RE: And black history's impact on Jeb

Governor --

As you can see from this thread, we are already considering this.  Here's my
idea:

1)  We immediately draft a response to the News-Journal saying we'll do it,
and remind them that this is a *continuation* of our tradition of
celebrating Black History Month.
2)  (Optional)  Send out a press release now, clarifying that we are taking
up the challenge of the News-Journal, not our idea.
3)  Submit the essay to the News-Journal (and statewide) after the New Year
TBA.  (When the kids submit 1/8, when the winners are announced 2/4, maybe
late January to not step on the 2/4 announcement?)

Liz's concerns are as follows (she's not necessarily against it)::
1)  Even though they challenged us, it could still look political.
2)  The Governor gets challenged to do things all the time (FCAT, etc).  Is
this really a precedent we want to set?

It's really your call, Governor.  Kathleen's in favor and Brian has some
ideas (in a different thread) to help me draft the actual essay.  I think
think could be fun and cool.

What do you think?

In other words, this matter of allowing pay-raise options is a local option?
I certainly want to be clear about this. I will have not hesitation to

Secondly, I am very pleased to note the categorical restrictions have been

Good morning!  As I write to you, 1500 copies of Exceptional Parent
magazine are being delivered in my office.  Congratulations, you are on
the cover and a they ran two great articles.  One on you and another on
Berthy and her family.  Really Luz is the star!  (The story begins on

Answer From the Family CAFE Conference 2001 books, both publications are
ready to be mailed to all the participants of last year's Family CAFE.
A holiday present to all.

Yesterday Joe Valenzano asked me on his behalf to deliver to you the
December issue of EP Magazine.  I know you are very busy, but I would
like to know if in the next few days if you would have 2 minutes to
spare so I may deliver both books to you.  If you are not available, I
would still like to drop the book and magazine off for you.  A holiday
gift from the Family CAFE and EP Magazine.  (Really a holiday thank you
from all of us!)

And lastly, I would like to be able to confirm your appearance at the
World Congress on Disabilities.  When interviewed you stated that you
would willing to be the keynote on Friday evening of  October 4, 2002.
The organizers have asked that I confirm the date and time.  I believe
that they are shooting for a 5:30 pm event similar to the CAFE, but
without the questions/answer session.   Please let me know who I should
be working with in your office.

Gov. Bush denies Brevard and Indian River counties money to renourish
beaches

By Linda Jump
FLORIDA TODAY

WABASSO -- Cheryl Gerstner has watched the beach in front of her
Surfside
Terrace home erode 20 feet, threatening to send her home into the
Atlantic
Ocean if more sand is lost. She's hoping Tropical Storm Olga won't take
any
more.

Brevard and Indian River counties officials are watching carefully too,
after learning that any immediate repairs to erosion will be paid either
by
them or private homeowners.

Gov. Jeb Bush determined this week that the $8 to $10 million worth of
damage reported by several East Coast counties after Hurricane Michelle
early this month didn't rise to the level needed to qualify for state or
federal emergency aid.

Indian River County had asked for $1 million in erosion control measures
to
help rebuild its beaches from the hurricane, which never hit land but
whipped up the surf, said Jonathan Gorham, county environmental
engineer.
Brevard asked for even less since previous work to save its shoreline
prevented major damage.

But Gorham said without a disaster declaration, both counties are left
without a lot of options. "It's the individual homeowner's
responsibility to
protect their property," Gorham said.

The state Office of Beaches and Shores on Thursday approved permits for
four
Dubloon Drive families north of the Wabasso Causeway to build sea walls,
and
issued a temporary permit for Surfside Terrace for sandbags and sand
until
more permanent measures can be taken.

Gerstner said that won't solve the problem. She has personally
purchased,
filled, tied and piled more than 1,000 sandbags "only to have them roll
on
the beach like they were styrofoam."

"We just want to solve our own problems with our own money to protect
our
property," Gerstner said.

Gorham said many think only hurricanes cause beach erosion, but often,
the
fall and winter northeasters cause as much, if not more, damage. "So
far, we
really haven't seen any affects from Tropical Storm Olga because the
waves
are nowhere as large as predicted," he said.

Nathan B. McCollum, emergency management coordinator, said Olga isn't
expected to hit land in Indian River County. Nor will it hit Brevard .
But
the swelled waves and eastern winds from the storm still could gouge
dunes,
he said.

Hurricane Michelle, on the other hand, took five to six feet of dune
daily
in some areas of the Indian River County after Nov. 6, Gorham said.

Cyber Citizens For Justice Dispatch - Distribute Widely -
http://www.ccfj.net/ 
 
Our Members and Friends attest to the facts: 
 
Dear Senator Steven Geller, Representative Eleanor Sobel, et al.,
 
The Staff Analysis of CS/SB 148: Relating to HOA's/U.S. Flag, indicates, as we've concluded; the primary reason for enacting meaningful reform is precipitated by HOA lawsuits against residents of deed restricted communities for erecting a FLAGPOLE or bracket (in the case of a CONDO unit owner) to display the U.S. Flag. 
 
We don't understand why current bills don't recognize; owners must be permitted to install a portable, removable or telescoping FLAGPOLE, a maximum height which could be twenty (20') feet, in the front, side or rear yard of their property. 
 
Likewise, CONDO unit owners must be permitted to install a bracket to the front of their unit to display the U.S. Flag. 
 
The issue of frivolous lawsuits is not about a '...portable, removable U.S. Flag...' because flags are; portable and removable. The flagpole is the heart and soul of this issue. 
 
In addition, U.S. Code Title 36 Chapter 10 provides the parameters for respectful display of the U.S. Flag and does not include the perogative for display using a pole or bracket. This may change as we continue to advocate for an amendment to the code at the Federal level?
 
In the meantime, the state of Florida can set the trend in the nation to  protect the rights of residents of deed restricted communities by including the provisions requested in any bill enacted during the 2002 Legislative session. 
 
In that vain, here's what others have to say about this issue.

Thank you for your consideration. We look forward to your reply. 
Sincerely,

From our friend, Stephen: 
 
The good news is that some judge will have to figure out what this bill changes from existing law.
 
Maybe the deletion of the language relating to size, placement, etc. will help and if (the) Senate analysis can be used as evidence, the mention of the Andres case might help.  
 
It could be better. It could be much better. 
 
If people are fighting over flagpoles mention flagpoles and brackets and end the issue.
 
I did like the Constitutional analysis as representing a fair reading of case law. At least they didn't simply conclude it was unconstitutional 
 
....and once enacted, there is a presumption that the legislature only enacts Constitutional laws.  
 
It doesn't mean they are always upheld as Constitutional but one gets a home court advantage once the law is passed.

Mr Bush, a portable pole is worse than no pole at all! 


I am not familar with the state politician who is sponsoring this bill, but I did vote for you!  Please help.

What is so wrong with a Flag pole in Florida's good earth? 


I mean, (picture this) some plants around it and maybe some ground landscape lighting (to display the) symbol of America. I guess we can not have American symbols in HOA's. Please help!  Craig

From our member, Willow Vance:
 
Dear Bob:
 
When Uncle Sam asks its citizens to give up their family, career and safety to be shot at or diseased for their fellow country men, everyone shouts about the glory of the flag. 
 
Why has the flag pole that flies it become so unwanted by those who are safe because others like my family and yours were willing to give their life.
 
My husband was buried early in March (at an) AFB Cemetery because of an illness contracted in the South Pacific untreated after World Wat Two...
 
My dearest brother-in-law lies buried in Arlington National Cemetery after 25 years of horror stories on the high seas in the Coast Guard and my sweetest Uncle was blown apart on D Day after he saved several shipmates in the Seabees with a total of 20 more who gave all.
 
I fly every flag from the Union Jack, Don't Tread on Me to Betsy Ross and I dare anyone get between me and my flag collection with all the scars and memories of the price we paid so dear.
 
The style setting empty soul jerks should move on an island where they have to defend themselves from headhunters without our help because they represent everything bad our ancestors ran away from to give birth to America. 
 
God save the USA and God forgive these tyrants! Such selfish ignorance.

We need a new flag for the unAmerican Americans so we know who to pray for...Born in America a long time ago and proud of it!

Subject:	An Afterthought on Education budget

I recently heard a radio report that indicated the revised education budget
still allows pay raises for school principals and assistant principals.
Frankly, if that is true, I am saddened and angry that such a caveat was
allowed. Good, dedicated teachers are just as valuable, if not moreso.
Without teachers there is no need for principals and assistant principals.
Furthermore, I find it repulsive that "all" employees are not included in
these budget cuts.

If the report is true, who was responsible for pushing that particular
clause?

On another note...I continue to be impressed with your brother's agenda with
the terrorists. Undoubtedly, you and your father must be proud. Likewise,
Laura Bush has done an excellent job as First Lady. She exudes an
appropriateness this "old fashioned" voter truly admires. When I look at
your brother's eyes as they gaze on her there is no doubt in my mind she
stayed the course and pulled him back in line when it was necessary. We all
have to grow up at one time or another. My wife can attest to that. I can
see strong similarities between Laura Bush and my wife when it comes to
being a strong woman in the house:)

Jeb, Good Morning.  You will remember the visit from the leadership of the John A. Hartford Foundation from New York to your office at the beginning of the Palm Beach Omega project.  Well, the Foundation funded the now-successful Palm Beach project generously and we also have 5 replication sites (Orlando, Gainesville, Bradenton, Brevard and Leon).  The executive staff of the Foundation and about half of their Board are visiting the Palm Beach site on Monday, January 14.  The Foundation asked me to contact you, as they would like to have a representative from your office join them for the day. Everything should be very positive with the visit--all is going very well. I have had some good conversations with Laura Branker and wondered if you thought she might be a good representative for this. I met Laura through a delightful telephone call in October about the DOEA Secretary position. We have actually worked for three of your finalists, Doug Beach, Terry White and Sam Navarro. I was thrilled when Sam called to tell me of her application.  She would bring a lot of the qualities you and I discussed by email in October.  Good luck!  I had brunch with Josefina in Washington last Sunday.  She loves her job! Thanks for your help on the Palm Beach visit. Just ask someone to contact me and I will take it from there.

thank you so much for your response. my programs was completely dismantle.  with these programs i was able to reach many youth and parents.  these progams allowed this administration the opportunity to provide information to youth and parents about available 
services to help them become productive and positive citizens, and a  indepedent .

that a  so few are aware of. (david griffin, jennifer carroll, marcia cooke,mary hooks).

============================================================================
===
=================================

George,

I'm back from the West Coast and am happy to say things went well out
there.  Now it's time to see what I can do about the problems back here.

While I was gone the SBA has for all practical purposes turned down the
loan application (long term/low interest) for the money to replace business
lost as a result of 9-11.  They didn't exactly turn it down but said if
we wanted the paperwork to go any farther in the consideration process,
each of my sons and myself must put our homes up as collateral.  We can't
do that.  If they want personal guarantees that would be different.  You
often have to give those for a loan, but never your house.  We tried to
tell them, 'what would happen if another plane flew into the Sears Tower
in Chicago, and no airline could or would be able to hire new pilots for
several years?'  All of us would not only lose the business, but our homes
as well and that is unsatisfactory.


They say that is the chance you must take if you want the loan.  So, no
loan!  We are willing to put our personal guarantee up but not our homes.

If I had to make a guess, we will now lose the Academy, and as you know
have already lost (through selling to a new owner) Discover Air.  In order
to just meet fixed and certain variable expenses, the academy has to bring
in 20 new students each month.   Thirteen have been enrolled for the
December
class and the rest (29) withdrew before they even arrived (we now have
over a million dollars in revenue withdrawls since 9-11), so that
accelerates
the end of something really quite good.  There will come a time when the
pilot shortage hits that those folks in Federal programs administration
and those folks we elect to public office will regret that they have allowed
a whole industry to flounder.  They think that by throwing a 'little'
money at the major airlines who could afford expensive lobbyists, that
they have done something heroic.  I have one trump card to play and that's
getting airlines that are going to need our services to step up to the
plate and tell the next generation of pilots that there is a future for
them in the airline business.  It may really be too late for Airline
Training
Academy, but maybe some others can get through this period intact.

George, if you have any plans for further involvement with the Academy,
do yourself and us a favor and terminate any time commitment.  There is
not money enough to pay our bills, such as gas, that allow us to continue
to instruct, let alone your invoice which you would have earned by the
end of December.  We have paid you for October and November but will not
be able to pay anything more.  There is not money for salaries for my
sons and so personal savings will get tapped just to make mortgage payments
from here on out.  I don't regret paying you the $5,000 in fees for
services,
I just wish that we had known you at a better time when we would have
benefited more from your association.

George, even though we won't be able to have a professional association,
we are still 'brothers in Christ'.  I wish you and Libby a Holy holiday
season and the very best possible in 2002 as things get better, we hope.
 God bless you and your entire family.

Thank you, Governor.
The piece can be tightened a bit. Additionally, I will be asking the
editors to allow us to put in the trim indicators or to make the cuts
ourselves. They are usually pretty receptive to that idea.

Dear Governor Bush, 

As you are aware, I would like to create an A+ School Recognition day in the state of Florida. I have secured the sponsorship of 578 A+ flags to be presented to all the A schools in the state of Florida on your behalf and behalf of the Florida legislature. We have been in contact with the Lt. Governor Brogan's office concerning the planning of a press conference detailing the kickoff of this event statewide. We came to a consensus that best time to hold this press conference and have you present is in January before the opening of the legislative session. My thought is to hold this press conference at Ernest R. Graham Elementary School a Miami Dade County Public School in my legislative district. 

I look forward to having this event become a reality. Thank you in advance for your continued support, I hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely, 


Ralph

Governor, 

As you noted, Article 8, Section 5, passed in 1998, allows any county to require a 3-5 day waiting period, and background check, for the sale of any firearm on property with public access, including gun shows.  [Other Florida law under Section 790.065, requires all licensed dealers to utilize background checks throughout the state. 790.0655 requires a 3-day waiting period between the purchase and the delivery at retail of any handgun.] 


We have learned that Broward, Volusia, Orange, Dade [informed by contact person,] Sarasota [informed by contact person,] Palm Beach, and Hillsborough  have opted in under the 1998 amendment that allows requiring waiting periods for gun sales, regardless of the nature or location of the sale. Each county may differ regarding whether they use the 1998 amendment to regulate all firearms or just handguns, whether they require a 3 or 5 day waiting period, etc. Orange and  Volusia limit their ordinances to handguns, even though they could cover all guns.  We are checking on other counties and have an information request into the Association of Counties. 

I don't believe there are lot more than these. One source said there are about seven counties that have opted in.

GOV--below is general outline for pbs program ref rebecca mattingly...with
suggested points from her office. this segement will be taped following your
FACE TO FACE interview on  12-13-01

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------
The Women in Your Life program, in short...premise is about Women of
influence in our State influencing and mentoring younger up and coming
females. The program series will premiere in November of this year with the
first person being Betty Jane France of NASCAR and The segment on Rebecca is
to air in the second program.

GENERAL QUESTIONS (not exact but these shared) :

Q-why was Rebecca your first choice for Florida's Film Commissioner?

A-RDM had the field experience, a great deal of industry knowledge,
enthusiasm, and the right attitude Florida needed to grow the economic
potetial that this clean industry represents to the State.

Q-what have been the biggest challenges Rebecca was able to overcome?

A- 1) To be seen as a leader and to gain the respect of the stateweide
industry and Florida's 49 film offices.
 
   2) To pull together a badly fragmented industry into a team that works
together to promote the film & entertainment 	   industry in Florida to
the nation & the world with a unified voice. 

   3) To overcome the negative perceptions left over from the misadventures
of the previous film office disbanded by Gov.         	   Chiles.

Q-how has she changed Florida's film industry?

A- Rebecca has channelled her energy, and within a short time ( less than
two years ) Rebecca and her office have pulled together Florida's film &
entertainment industry. The Office of Film & Entertainment is now seen as
the driving force behind Florida's production industry. Passed significant
legislation that now provides an up-front sales tax exemption on production
related expenses (a new incentive for productions to be filmed in Florida
rather than other competing locations), and has represented my office well.
 
Q-What personal and professional characteristics allow her to be such a
strong role model?

A-She has a positive attitude on life and shares this with those she
mentors. She is a leader and takes the time to help others.

Q- General feelings about Rebecca as an individual?

A-I enjoy having her work on my team and she is a brite and capable
employee.

Q- How do you feel about mentoring in general?

A-I believe the Gov. is more than adequate on this subject!

Brian, as soon as I walked in my office this morning I had a group of avocado and tropical fruit growers (all Cuban-Americans) in a conference call. They are upset because the governor persuaded a number of Florida delegation members to vote for TPA. But they had also heard that the governor had written a letter to President Bush urging more Mexican product, including avocados enter the U.S. Market. I denied that such letter existed, at least to my knowledge. 

In summary, they are pissed. And obviously the rumors are a dime a dozen. It is important that we proceed with our wish list to the W. H.,  as well as in some form or other the farm community needs to learn that Governor Bush, although a free trader, supports Florida farmers above all.

Letters to the Editor

Be Prepared: Supply And Demand Also Affects Taxes 


I have been reading a lot of comments from citizens of Florida who are disgusted with the cuts in the state budget. The legislation from the second emergency session has produced a bill that slashes another $1.3 billion from the state's budget. These deep throat cuts are aimed at the most needed services in Florida. The elderly, Medicaid and Medicare, child-abuse prevention and family services, safety, and all educational institutions are affected by these cuts. 


When I see these headlines of articles and letters to the editor like "Don't Sacrifice Children, Elders To Balance Budget," I start thinking back to last year's attempts by the Legislature to pass SB 310 and 380. This was a growth management bill coupled with the educational needs of districts in the state, giving taxation abilities to school boards and county commissions instead of voters. By a majority vote of these boards, they would have been able to increase local sales-tax amounts. Also included in the language were ways the school districts could raise local millage rates above the state's maximum allowable rate for capital expenditures. 


But this bill died because of the haggling back and forth over specific language that I can only guess was for more special interests. As I stated last year when SB 310 and 380 weren't passed, the timing wasn't quite right to receive the support of the citizens of Florida for tax increases. But I also said it would be back in the next regular session of the Legislature, and that it would pass with their full support. Now that all these deep throat cuts to the most vital needs in the state have been made, the citizens of Florida will now be more receptive to a tax increase. Just like everything else in the economy . . . to be able to raise the price (taxes), there has to be both a demand and a shortage. We now have both, so be prepared!

Good Evening Governor!
Glad that you read it.  Ned has checked and believes that the Herald will
most likely run it as written.  I do not know of the Times.  If you approve
of the basic thrust, we can do a shortened version that highlights:  1)
Judge Moreno was right.  2) There have been significant improvements and
systemic reform since you took office.  3) Gievers and her minions of trial
lawyers have done nothing to improve the system and instead have taken
precious resources away from the very children that they profess to
represent.  I thought it was time to take the gloves off and defend not
only what we have done, but also defend the judge that had the guts to rule
on the law and the evidence presented regardless of the media onslaught.
Carol Licko is also preparing a piece.

Thanks for all of your time today.  I met with Amy Baker (aka budget girl)
this evening on the substance abuse piece.  Ronda Meadows and I have
scheduled a developmental services meeting for Thursday with our respective
staffs to discuss waiver and other issues.  TANF reauthorization is heating
up in the House and we may need you to weigh in again on the supplemental
grant.  Karen Hogan and the DC crew is on top of it and will let you know.
Doreen Rutledge is getting toys from all over and is very grateful for your
help.  All in all, a busy but productive time at DCF.  Thanks again for
your support.

Here is the draft of the BonnieL/Moreno op ed for the Miami Herald.
It is coming to you a bit later than I imagined that it would, but I
didn't
want to leave without getting a copy to you. I know that the Governor
wanted a prompt response to the editorial.

Please let me know  what your thoughts are as soon as possible, so that
we

home
at nedcarroll@aol.com, if you want me to make changes before tomorrow)

Also, please know that we will probably alter it slightly, once

to submit to the Sun-Sentinel and the New York Times, per our earlier

Gov. Bush denies Brevard and Indian River counties money to renourish
beaches

By Linda Jump
FLORIDA TODAY

WABASSO -- Cheryl Gerstner has watched the beach in front of her
Surfside
Terrace home erode 20 feet, threatening to send her home into the
Atlantic
Ocean if more sand is lost. She's hoping Tropical Storm Olga won't take
any
more.

Brevard and Indian River counties officials are watching carefully too,
after learning that any immediate repairs to erosion will be paid either
by
them or private homeowners.

Gov. Jeb Bush determined this week that the $8 to $10 million worth of
damage reported by several East Coast counties after Hurricane Michelle
early this month didn't rise to the level needed to qualify for state or
federal emergency aid.

Indian River County had asked for $1 million in erosion control measures
to
help rebuild its beaches from the hurricane, which never hit land but
whipped up the surf, said Jonathan Gorham, county environmental
engineer.
Brevard asked for even less since previous work to save its shoreline
prevented major damage.

But Gorham said without a disaster declaration, both counties are left
without a lot of options. "It's the individual homeowner's
responsibility to
protect their property," Gorham said.

The state Office of Beaches and Shores on Thursday approved permits for
four
Dubloon Drive families north of the Wabasso Causeway to build sea walls,
and
issued a temporary permit for Surfside Terrace for sandbags and sand
until
more permanent measures can be taken.

Gerstner said that won't solve the problem. She has personally
purchased,
filled, tied and piled more than 1,000 sandbags "only to have them roll
on
the beach like they were styrofoam."

"We just want to solve our own problems with our own money to protect
our
property," Gerstner said.

Gorham said many think only hurricanes cause beach erosion, but often,
the
fall and winter northeasters cause as much, if not more, damage. "So
far, we
really haven't seen any affects from Tropical Storm Olga because the
waves
are nowhere as large as predicted," he said.

Nathan B. McCollum, emergency management coordinator, said Olga isn't
expected to hit land in Indian River County. Nor will it hit Brevard .
But
the swelled waves and eastern winds from the storm still could gouge
dunes,
he said.

Hurricane Michelle, on the other hand, took five to six feet of dune
daily
in some areas of the Indian River County after Nov. 6, Gorham said.

Area has stake in board vacancy



Drought and concerns about phosphate mining place added significance on the task of filling a vacant seat on the Peace River Basin Board.


Punta Gorda resident Tom D'Andrea unexpectedly resigned his position on the board recently and care must be taken to appoint someone who not only has knowledge of Southwest Florida's water resources but someone who can commit to standing up for our best interests.


D'Andrea's resignation came shortly after Don Ross -- Charlotte County's second, and only other, delegate -- moved from the county and was forced to step down. Ross was replaced by former Punta Gorda Mayor Rufus Lazell.


The board plays an important role in shaping water-related policy in Southwest Florida. The six-pers! on board is charged with investigating issues regarding water in the five-county basin and recommending solutions and policy to the Southwest Florida Water Management District, also known as SWIFTMUD.


In recent months, sentiments on the board have swung from one extreme to the next as representatives from inland counties sought to protect their water resources from being diverted to fast-growing coastal counties. Board members from Polk and DeSoto counties have also voiced support for phosphate mining -- an industry they are relying on for economic development.


Charlotte County has sometimes stood alone in its battle to force more extensive studies of the effects of phosphate mining on the Peace River, which provides drinking water to Charlotte County, North Port and eventually Sarasota County.


The fact Charlotte County is the lone government with two representatives speaks of its size and the underdog role its board members embrace. Their greatest chal! lenge is to convince representatives of smaller, inland counties to be more proactive in protecting the few water resources we have while planning for alternative sources.


D'Andrea was an outspoken proponent of protecting the Peace River and Horse Creek. His voice on the board will be missed.


The process of nominating a replacement is a wide-open affair. While no names have surfaced publicly, it would benefit all coastal communities if local politicos and Charlotte County officials work together to support a qualified, dedicated nominee.


Even though all Peace River Basin recommendations must be approved by SWIFTMUD, the importance of coming up with fact-based, responsible policies cannot be stressed enough. Charlotte County's next representative will shoulder an important responsibility We must seek out a quality nominee.

David asked me to advise you that we have worked with DCA to respond to
the
Daytona Beach News Journal story below.  We have provided DCA with the
positive news of the state's extraordinary efforts toward beach
renourishment.  DCA took the lead in responding to the question of
funding
based upon their role as coordinator with FEMA on these matters.  It was
determined that there was insufficient "eligible" damages to justify a
disaster request to FEMA.  Bottom line: we are responding while
remaining on
offense.  Best regards.

Jeb, Good Morning.  You will remember the visit from the leadership of the John A. Hartford Foundation from New York to your office at the beginning of the Palm Beach Omega project.  Well, the Foundation funded the now-successful Palm Beach project generously and we also have 5 replication sites (Orlando, Gainesville, Bradenton, Brevard and Leon).  The executive staff of the Foundation and about half of their Board are visiting the Palm Beach site on Monday, January 14.  The Foundation asked me to contact you, as they would like to have a representative from your office join them for the day. Everything should be very positive with the visit--all is going very well. I have had some good conversations with Laura Branker and wondered if you thought she might be a good representative for this. I met Laura through a delightful telephone call in October about the DOEA Secretary position. We have actually worked for three of your finalists, Doug Beach, Terry White and Sam Navarro. I was thrilled when Sam called to tell me of her application.  She would bring a lot of the qualities you and I discussed by email in October.  Good luck!  I had brunch with Josefina in Washington last Sunday.  She loves her job! Thanks for your help on the Palm Beach visit. Just ask someone to contact me and I will take it from there.  Margaret Lynn

My husband complained about the lack of a response re this matter on 10/26/01 by letter to you at 2900 Appalachee Way in Tallahassee.  There has been no response to this letter, so I am wondering what it takes to motivate someone there to do something to remedy the situation.

Good Evening Governor!
Glad that you read it.  Ned has checked and believes that the Herald
will
most likely run it as written.  I do not know of the Times.  If you
approve
of the basic thrust, we can do a shortened version that highlights:  1)
Judge Moreno was right.  2) There have been significant improvements and
systemic reform since you took office.  3) Gievers and her minions of
trial
lawyers have done nothing to improve the system and instead have taken
precious resources away from the very children that they profess to
represent.  I thought it was time to take the gloves off and defend not
only what we have done, but also defend the judge that had the guts to
rule
on the law and the evidence presented regardless of the media onslaught.
Carol Licko is also preparing a piece.

Thanks for all of your time today.  I met with Amy Baker (aka budget
girl)
this evening on the substance abuse piece.  Ronda Meadows and I have
scheduled a developmental services meeting for Thursday with our
respective
staffs to discuss waiver and other issues.  TANF reauthorization is
heating
up in the House and we may need you to weigh in again on the
supplemental
grant.  Karen Hogan and the DC crew is on top of it and will let you
know.
Doreen Rutledge is getting toys from all over and is very grateful for
your
help.  All in all, a busy but productive time at DCF.  Thanks again for
your support.

Hi Liz.

Here is the draft of the BonnieL/Moreno op ed for the Miami Herald.
It is coming to you a bit later than I imagined that it would, but I
didn't
want to leave without getting a copy to you. I know that the Governor
wanted a prompt response to the editorial.

Please let me know  what your thoughts are as soon as possible, so that
we
can try to get it out early tomorrow. (You can message me tonight at
home
at nedcarroll@aol.com, if you want me to make changes before tomorrow)

Also, please know that we will probably alter it slightly, once
approved,
to submit to the Sun-Sentinel and the New York Times, per our earlier
discussion.

Thanks very much

Good Evening Governor!
Glad that you read it.  Ned has checked and believes that the Herald will
most likely run it as written.  I do not know of the Times.  If you approve
of the basic thrust, we can do a shortened version that highlights:  1)
Judge Moreno was right.  2) There have been significant improvements and
systemic reform since you took office.  3) Gievers and her minions of trial
lawyers have done nothing to improve the system and instead have taken
precious resources away from the very children that they profess to
represent.  I thought it was time to take the gloves off and defend not
only what we have done, but also defend the judge that had the guts to rule
on the law and the evidence presented regardless of the media onslaught.
Carol Licko is also preparing a piece.

Thanks for all of your time today.  I met with Amy Baker (aka budget girl)
this evening on the substance abuse piece.  Ronda Meadows and I have
scheduled a developmental services meeting for Thursday with our respective
staffs to discuss waiver and other issues.  TANF reauthorization is heating
up in the House and we may need you to weigh in again on the supplemental
grant.  Karen Hogan and the DC crew is on top of it and will let you know.
Doreen Rutledge is getting toys from all over and is very grateful for your
help.  All in all, a busy but productive time at DCF.  Thanks again for
your support.

the
Daytona Beach News Journal story below.  We have provided DCA with the
positive news of the state's extraordinary efforts toward beach
renourishment.  DCA took the lead in responding to the question of
funding
based upon their role as coordinator with FEMA on these matters.  It was
determined that there was insufficient "eligible" damages to justify a
disaster request to FEMA.  Bottom line: we are responding while
remaining on
offense.  Best regards.

Gov. Bush denies Brevard and Indian River counties money to renourish
beaches

By Linda Jump
FLORIDA TODAY

WABASSO -- Cheryl Gerstner has watched the beach in front of her
Surfside
Terrace home erode 20 feet, threatening to send her home into the
Atlantic
Ocean if more sand is lost. She's hoping Tropical Storm Olga won't take
any
more.

Brevard and Indian River counties officials are watching carefully too,
after learning that any immediate repairs to erosion will be paid either
by
them or private homeowners.

Gov. Jeb Bush determined this week that the $8 to $10 million worth of
damage reported by several East Coast counties after Hurricane Michelle
early this month didn't rise to the level needed to qualify for state or
federal emergency aid.

Indian River County had asked for $1 million in erosion control measures
to
help rebuild its beaches from the hurricane, which never hit land but
whipped up the surf, said Jonathan Gorham, county environmental
engineer.
Brevard asked for even less since previous work to save its shoreline
prevented major damage.

But Gorham said without a disaster declaration, both counties are left
without a lot of options. "It's the individual homeowner's
responsibility to
protect their property," Gorham said.

The state Office of Beaches and Shores on Thursday approved permits for
four
Dubloon Drive families north of the Wabasso Causeway to build sea walls,
and
issued a temporary permit for Surfside Terrace for sandbags and sand
until
more permanent measures can be taken.

Gerstner said that won't solve the problem. She has personally
purchased,
filled, tied and piled more than 1,000 sandbags "only to have them roll
on
the beach like they were styrofoam."

"We just want to solve our own problems with our own money to protect
our
property," Gerstner said.

Gorham said many think only hurricanes cause beach erosion, but often,
the
fall and winter northeasters cause as much, if not more, damage. "So
far, we
really haven't seen any affects from Tropical Storm Olga because the
waves
are nowhere as large as predicted," he said.

Nathan B. McCollum, emergency management coordinator, said Olga isn't
expected to hit land in Indian River County. Nor will it hit Brevard .
But
the swelled waves and eastern winds from the storm still could gouge
dunes,
he said.

Hurricane Michelle, on the other hand, took five to six feet of dune
daily
in some areas of the Indian River County after Nov. 6, Gorham said.

Subject: County opt-in under Fla. Constitution, Article 8, Section 5 re: gun sales



Governor, 

As you noted, Article 8, Section 5, passed in 1998, allows any county to require a 3-5 day waiting period, and background check, for the sale of any firearm on property with public access, including gun shows.  [Other Florida law under Section 790.065, requires all licensed dealers to utilize background checks throughout the state. 790.0655 requires a 3-day waiting period between the purchase and the delivery at retail of any handgun.] 


We have learned that Broward, Volusia, Orange, Dade [informed by contact person,] Sarasota [informed by contact person,] Palm Beach, and Hillsborough  have opted in under the 1998 amendment that allows requiring waiting periods for gun sales, regardless of the nature or location of the sale. Each county may differ regarding whether they use the 1998 amendment to regulate all firearms or just handguns, whether they require a 3 or 5 day waiting period, etc. Orange and  Volusia limit their ordinances to handguns, even though they could cover all guns.  We are checking on other counties and have an information request into the Association of Counties. 

I don't believe there are lot more than these. One source said there are about seven counties that have opted in.

thank you for sharing this. We are under constant pressure to provide more services (increase folks served) and raise prices for the providers. Wants are always translated to needs and government grows. It is a never ending challenge. Government will consume all of the income of the taxpayers if we are not careful. I sympathize with your concerns, I truly do.

Subject: an e-mail to your real address


I sent this a few weeks ago in response to your announcement about state employees getting an increase.  It was to the "myflorida address" so I don't think you read it.  Here is the text of the message:
 
Dear Governor,

I am in the private sector, providing rehabilitative services for juvenile
offenders.  While I am happy that DJJ workers are getting another COLA
increase I felt that you should know that providers have not had their
per-diem rates adjusted since 1990.  How long can a business maintain
quality service when the revenue streams remain static?

The company I work for operates two programs at the lowest DJJ per diem
available, $75 per day.  Recent studies put the cost of similar providers in
other states much higher.  Juvenile crime is down, recidivism rates are
down, the private providers in our state have served you well.  What will it
take for you to recognize our work and see to it that we can afford quality
staff to do a most difficult task?  Will recidivism have to climb?  Will
juvenile crime have to increase before you spend some time evaluating
revenue streams that are over a decade old?  Sometimes we feel that we are
simply training people in the industry for the Department of Juvenile
Justice because as soon as they have training and some experience, they can
go to DJJ and work for thousands of dollars more.

I don't want to damper your enthusiasm for your state worker's pay increase,

Hi Liz.

Here is the draft of the BonnieL/Moreno op ed for the Miami Herald.
It is coming to you a bit later than I imagined that it would, but I didn't
want to leave without getting a copy to you. I know that the Governor
wanted a prompt response to the editorial.

Please let me know  what your thoughts are as soon as possible, so that we
can try to get it out early tomorrow. (You can message me tonight at home
at nedcarroll@aol.com, if you want me to make changes before tomorrow)

Also, please know that we will probably alter it slightly, once approved,
to submit to the Sun-Sentinel and the New York Times, per our earlier
discussion.

Thanks very much

I haven't "bothered" you much lately because I know that you and your
brother have been extremely busy. However, the fire that leveled the IGA in
Carrabelle has caused a difficulty I never expected. The prices at the
convenience stores/gas stations for bread, milk, etc. rose on the very SAME
day of the fire. (Two of these stations were fined after Sept. 11 for
raising gas prices also!) I don't mind...we can drive elsewhere, but there
are a lot of older people in town who don't have that option and could only
get to the IGA by using a golf cart or walking. Is there someone from your
consumer affairs dept. that could look into this for those poor souls?

Thanks, Pat

good piece. the fact that the readiness programs are housed in AWI and not the DOE is not an indication of lack of support. We have increased support for readiness programs and want to do more. I agree that reading needs to a comprehensive mission including K-12, family literacy, schools of education and early readiness. You are on the right track and I think we are as well. Onward,

Caught between the political fires: Kids who can't read
Published December 11, 2001

We're going about this the wrong way. Educators pounce on politicians for
sticking their noses into schoolhouse business, promising quick fixes on the
cheap that cost more later. Old GOP hands blast liberal-leaning teacher
unions and stagnant academic bureaucracies for shutting out reform.

Caught between the political fire are thousands of Florida children who keep
flunking reading but get promoted to the next grade anyway. This abomination
has to stop.

Gov. Jeb Bush and the Legislature thought it had. Social promotion surely
leads to dropouts. But school districts use a loophole in the law to keep
passing ill-prepared students so as not to hurt the kiddies' feelings. Or
maybe to not burden already cramped Trailer Towns called schools.

Let's backtrack here. Fourth grade is way too late to correct a situation
that usually starts before kindergarten. Well-to-do parents know this. For
years the upwardly mobile have sought to have their kids outperform others.
They see no shame in holding back their preschooler if he or she isn't quite
ready for kindergarten. That extra year opens up the world to a more mature
and inquisitive child.

The challenge for Florida lawmakers is to fix the law so that
inquisitiveness is not solely a middle-class outcome. Last year three in 10
fourth-graders in public schools failed the Florida Comprehensive Assessment
Test. One in 100 was held back. Same old. Bush calls it a "quiet scandal."
Prefacing: "Sadly, many districts are lacking the courage to hold back
students and remediate."

Bush wants children who have trouble reading to get tutored, attend summer
school. You go, Jeb! But it must begin in pre-kindergarten. Yes, pre-K. That
can't be an afterthought. Yet in tight budget scrapes, school districts
slash summer school first. Pre-K? Not on Jeb's radar in his K-20 reform that
set up a superboard to oversee public schools and universities.

The governor supports school readiness -- it's just not fully funded. Never
has been, even when the Democrats ran things. Yet if we would focus on
preparing each and every child for basic skills in pre-K, taxpayers' money
would be spent more efficiently than having to pay millions more later on
remediation. It's smart business, smart politics. Predictably, the
Legislature's Republican majority resists making pre-K mandatory. Oh, they
throw a little money at the problem, but not enough to help all the ones who
would benefit most.

Overlay the demographics of poverty and single parents' lack of education,
and you'll find the place where many children struggling to read in fourth
grade languish today. Too many live in homes where books are the exception
and television rules.

It's parents' responsibility to prepare their children, but what if mama or
papa won't? Kids don't get to choose their parents. Should the schools, with
society's nod, just pass along the "problem," year after year, point to the
parents and smugly doom those kids to mediocrity?

A democratic society that values equal opportunity must demand that all
children get a good start. It's critical for Orlando to attract high-tech
jobs, too.

Fiscal conservatives must see the economic-development benefits of offering
pre-K to all children. Not just for those kids whose parents can afford
private preschool. But instead of expanding the pre-K program, which serves
a fraction of the kids who need it, Bush & Co. moved that program out of the
public schools. Now day-care centers or others will get some state money for
pre-K, but that "bargain" still leaves most poor kids waiting to get in.

The governor protected education from deeper budget cuts during the latest
belt-tightening. Overall, he has increased education spending during his
term and demanded more accountability. That's to his credit, but unless he
moves decisively on pre-K reform, Jeb's well-meaning Reading by Nine push
won't amount to more than a slogan that pulls at the heart with near-empty
purse strings.

Dear Governor;
 
I know how busy you are in these difficult times, and I apologize, in advance, for disturbing you.  But I know you have said many times how concerned you are about kids, especially seriously ill kids. 
 
Stormy Burn is a 13 year old wheelchair bound quadriplegic.  He is now bedridden and in severe pain at Florida Hospital East in Orlando.  You met Stormy last year concerning the Medically Essential Utility Law.  He was in Tallahassee with the other families.
 
Stormy's mother, Katie, pleaded with the Children's Medical Service to put a feeding tube in Stormy because he was not getting enough nourishment by mouth and he was losing weight.  Stormy was down to 61 pounds and his mother was afraid that his bones were going to become brittle, as they often do, with these children.  It took a year, and her having to sit on the floor in the emergency room of the hospital and threaten not to leave until they put the feeding tube in him.  The doctors at C.M.S. finally decided to do so.  By this time, the child's bones have gotten so brittle, that every time they move him they are afraid of breaking his bones.  Are they not suppose to be helping these families?
 
Stormy started to feel pain in his body and a fracture showed up on a scan that was done by an emergency room doctor. A cast was put on, and the doctor told the mother it would have to stay on for about 4 weeks.  When Mrs. Burn went to the Children's Medical Services Doctors at Nemourse Clinic at Arnold Palmer,
she was told he did not need to keep the cast on and they removed it.  They strongly refused to replace the cast.  Dr. Phillips and his associate, Dr. Burnbaum, twisted the childs foot and leg in so many directions that they made him cry and yell.  Stormy has not been the same.  He was sent home in constant pain and was told by Bernice, the Orthopedic Nurse, that they do not address pain management and not to bring him in for pain. He was bedridden and without any medication to help relieve his pain.  His mother and older brother could not turn him or touch him without him crying in pain. They have given him an appointment in January to see an Orthopedic doctor.  This is ridiculous.  Stormy is presently at Florida Hospital East and is on heavy pain medication.  He may have a bone infection, and they have found a fracture in his right ankle.  He may be sent home again without pain medication by Dr. Goetz, another C.M.S practitioner.  Animals are treated better!
 
Stormy's mother and brother have dedicated their lives to Stormy.  Their lives are centered upon him and his needs.  It is very frustrating to them and frightening not to be able to trust the doctors they need to help Stormy.
 
I have had many experiences with the Children's Medical Services  over my 18 years helping these families, and I can tell you these families are not treated justly.  The level of care is substandard, to say the least, with personnel who are nasty and vindictive and doctors who haven't a clue to a child's needs.
 
Stormy needs help and he needs it now.  I know they think his mom is a big mouth.  But when you see your child not getting the treatment needed, and you have to wait a year for treatment, my patience would run out too.  More parents have to speak up and not be afraid of retribution.  
 
I am asking, before something else goes wrong with Stormy Burn, for your assistance in getting this child and other children like him assistance before it is too late.  This child will die if he does not get the proper attention.
 
The Children's Medical Service is another example of a good idea gone bad.  It is a waste of money and energy.  Bernice, the Orthopedic Nurse, needs to find another profession and so do some of the doctors Mrs. Burn has had to deal with.
 
Respectfully,

Dear John:
 
It was a pleasure speaking with you regarding Agere Systems and the valued relationship your company maintains with the State of Florida.  The investments Agere has made in business expansions and job creation in Florida has contributed to greatly to our economy.  Equally important has been your companys role as a partner in economic development programsfrom participation in the Florida High Tech Corridor to providing chairs at the University of Central Florida and the University of South Florida.
 
Fully recognizing the difficult times facing your industry, I want to emphasize that Floridas commitment to fostering the growth of technology-based industry clusters remains steadfast.  Florida has partnered with your company in the past, and we are ready to do so again to ensure your continued successparticularly in research and development realms.
 
With a focus on the optoelectronics and photonics, there are particularly unique opportunities for Agere to excel in Florida.  As you may be aware, the University of Central Florida (UCF) is recognized as among the top three schools in the nation (if not world) for optical science and engineering, and its Center for Research and Education in Optics and Lasers (CREOL  www.creol.ucf.edu <http://www.creol.ucf.edu/> ) is in class amongst itself.   Beyond espousing incredible research, UCF and CREOL are producing optoelectronics graduates highly sought in the private sectormany of whom have assumed employment at Agere.  With an obvious shared vision, it would seem very advantageous for UCF to work closely with Agere Sytems to build upon research and development programs that will lead to model innovations.  
 
I have asked John Hitt, UCF President to contact your office to strategize on how UCF and CREOL can best incorporate Agere into its varied research and development programs.   Perhaps this could include relocation of some of Ageres optoelectronics programs presently based in New Jersey.  From both a vantage of academic excellence and financial feasibility, I am confident that Florida could greatly benefit Agere Systems in its continued growth plans.
 
Until then, I wish you all the best and welcome you to contact me whenever I might be of assistance.
 
Sincerely,

Dear Governor Bush:
As well as saying hello, Bill Farley suggested I keep this note to you
brief.
Thanks again for getting me and my colleagues in front of Kim Bahrami and
her staff  theyve been great!
Based on public information about your technology vision for Florida, time
is a critical element.  In the first two U.S. attempts to effect massive
change with regards to the strategic use of technology in government
(Connecticut, and the County of San Diego), even more critical than time was
the direct involvement of the Chief Executive.
My two colleagues from the Law firm of Gordon & Glickson and I would like to
schedule a meeting with you (or, in an effort to get on your schedule
earlier, a phone conference) during which we will brief you on our
experiences in CT and San Diego, as they apply to Florida, particularly
those issues that you must focus on very early, in order to successfully
move forward.
Please have your scheduler contact me by phone or email and I will make the
arrangements with Mark Gordon and Michael Moss to be wherever we need to be
at your option.

My Dear Jeb , 

As the polls show, your economic recovery efforts are falling behind the curve and you have yet to deal with the 2.1 Billion more in cuts that you will be addressing in the next regular legislative session. 

May I suggest that you consider going with the ADM and Democrats plans for Ethanol as a viable economic solution to diversity in the Fla revenue market? 

I previously sent to you and your staff the synfuel developments of an out of state corportation using garbage and plasma conversion to produce syn fuels and destroy toxic waste. 

You really should pay more attention to these new revenue sources. 

I would be more than happy to speak with you but not your subordinates directly on this. Or perhaps  send you some additional information on the idea of using the Fla sunshine to produce alternative. fuels and electrical power for growth and production of drinking water. 

Or you can work on a plan to explain to Fla voters why Fla prisions are being emptied of violent criminals, medicade is being cut back, mentally ill are roaming the streets and the overcrowded and unsafe fire trap state schools rank 50 out of 50 in state funding behind all other states. 

Don't forget the promised statewide water shortages and the high levels of  unemployment and school/ university over crowding current and projected. 

Have a Merry Christmas Jeb

At the past Cafe I heard you speak on the Choice and Control pilot project.  My son Kent Pearson is a participate in this program and I was on the committee to set up the pilot for our District in the Tallahassee area.  I understand this project is to be cut either part or whole in the budget the legislators have given to you for signing.  I urge you to line item veto this.  The nursing agency can not staff our case full time, my wife had to quit work to fill the gaps.  This project has been able to help make up some of this lost income.  We are a family of four living on just 24,000.00 a year.  As a state worker even that is in question.  With the project we have been able to get items my son has needed for years to help him live at home with the family.  I could go on, but I know time is as important to you as it to me.  If I can help in anyway to keep this project alive contact me at 443-7015 this is a Tallahassee number.  Thank you,  Shawn Pearson

Subject: Recommended Veto Items


Dear Governor,

You will recall that I sent an E-mail to you last week urging you to veto
line items 570 and 189B of the Legislative Appropriation Act that resulted
from the most recent Special Legislative Session.  I understand that a
substitute amendment was offered late in the legislative process that may
make the veto of line item 570 no longer necessary.

However, Governor, I would still urge you to veto line item 189B.  I have
enumerated the following points to assist you in your decision making
process:

    The language in the implementing Act, 4C, Section 5 cancels the
existing
procurement for the development and operation of a 600 bed facility for the
treatment of sexually violent predators

    This cancellation limits the ability of your office and the state to
secure the best, most cost effective solution to the housing and treatment
of this growing, dangerous population.

    The issues regarding the procurement or the best approach to dealing
with
the housing and treatment of the population were never debated in
legislative Committee nor were they discussed in Conference.

    The process whereby this occurred does not suggest government in the
sunshine and sends a devastating signal to the Florida business Community
who currently are, or who seek to do business with the State of Florida

    This language effectively makes a decision which does not comport with
the
recommendations of your own Task Force which convened approximately one
year
ago to address the needs of the State in dealing with this dangerous
population.

    In a recent Ft. Lauderdale Sun Sentinel Article it was noted that the
courts have recently released some of these dangerous criminals to the
community because funding was running out and evaluations, therefore, were
not able to be completed in a timely legal manner.  Yet, line item 189B
cuts
$300,000 from the remainder of this years budget.

    This language is totally unnecessary for the Correctional
Privatization
Commission and the Department of Children and Families to proceed to
determine the most cost effective way to deal with this population: In
fact,
it limits those options.

Governor, as the successful bidder on this project, we stand ready to
assist
both agencies in arriving at the most cost effective solution.  We
respectfully request that opportunity and again urge you to veto line items
189B, thus, nullifying its corresponding language in the implementing bill.

Thank you!
George Zoley
Wackenhut Corrections Corporation

According to Dave Pridgeon, Deputy Director for Institutions at DC, the following is the status on Mr. Hathaway. This conflicts with the information below:

*	This individual is in the custody of Escambia county jail as he is a state witness in a criminal case. He has been "out to court" since 12-05-01. It could be he is exchanging testimony for some change in sentence but this is unknown. 

*	He is not scheduled for release until 2014 

*	There have been no reports of use of force on this inmate. 

*	There is no DC medical record indicating liver or any other cancer. 

*	On 5-14-01 a lesion was biopsied from his lip and the reports were clear. 

*	He was scheduled for some follow up medical tests on 11-20-01 but did not fast for them as instructed, so they were not conducted. 

*	When he left for Escambia county he was showing no distress of any kind 

*	It is noted that Mr. Hathaway has a very extensive record including 2 prior prison terms and multiple community supervision sentences. He is 30 years old and has been involved in the adult criminal justice system since 1990. 


As you know, the state would be responsible to treat him for any illness, including cancer. There were no budget cuts to the agency's health care budget. It is unclear whether Mr. Hathaway's fianc, Starla, is inferring that DC officers beat him, other inmates or jail personnel. According to Mr. Pridgeon, there is nothing on the DC record to indicate anything of this nature. With more information we may be able to ask DC to initiate an investigation if warranted. I will gladly speak with Starla to try to get some clarity regarding her concerns if I could receive some way to speak with her. 

Please let me know if I can provide further information or assist in any way.

done a budget cut and he may not get the treatment he needs. He was 
suppose to be released November 28, but the Prosecuting Attorney is 
fighting it. If he stays in there, the cancer will spread and he could

Here is another special operations project and request for assistance. (You

and Maritime Security effort.  Tim Moore, Steve Lauer, and DEP joined me in
a meeting last week w/ group to vett and ensure coordination.  Steve
recommended a meeting with SOCOM Deputy CINC which is scheduled for January.
STRICOM is working closely w/ effort--both developing simulations and
vouching for project on behalf of the Army. STRICOM sent a rep to our
meeting.  The company reps are requesting our support through a letter to
Young and Boyd.

All this special ops training stuff is a bit much to stay on top of...but,
we have a window of opportunity to own the effort.  Good news is that all
the projects and efforts are in sync and working together.  General
Kostelnik would be perfect to pull together all of these efforts on behalf
of the Panhandle.  I have presented the idea to him and asked what it would
take to have him take on.  He could also pursue his dream of bringing R&D

Marla,
I want to thank Dr, Dana You and Brett for arranging our meeting on this
very important matter.

The total investment expenditure on infrastructure and improvements for
G-MAC not including the Integrated Range Facility is $1.3M.The building on
the Apalachicola Airport is part of the lease arrangement and funding for
the building is arranged by Franklin County. US Special Operations Command
who we are negotiating with will be the ultimate source of funding. There
will be no improvements to the landing strips at Apalachicola Airport they
are in excellent shape. The $4.4M is used for operations and maintenance.
EER Systems will  provide housing and feeding of personnel when deployed to
either Blue or Gold  Forward Operating Base. EER will also provide all
transportation, integrated logistics and security support. The training plan
for G-MAC excluding the Integrated Range Facility is 150 personnel per day.
75 personnel  training in the Apalachicola area and 75 personnel training in
the Liberty County and Calhoun County area. Training will be conducted from
the 3rd Friday in February till Thanksgiving weekend or 40 weeks of training
per year. The down time in  training allows G-MAC  maintenance time and not
interfere with hunting season.

Time line for construction, as soon as we receive a commitment from USSOCOM,
be operational in 5 months. The Environmental Assessment has been completed
and turned into the State of Florida DEP. We are now working with Connie
Krystoff, Environmental Administrator for submerged lands and environmental
resources programs Northwest District. Mrs. Krystoff has asked us for an
environmental management plan that covers the areas that we will be working
in. This plan has been written but not turned into the District for
approval, we are waiting for further commitments from USSOCOM.

EER Systems agreement with USSOCOM is for EER  to lease the properties for a
minimum 20 years the government has no problems with this leasing
arrangement.

Briefings planned for continued support. We would like the State of Florida
to fully endorse the Gulf Maritime Assistance Center in letter  to US
Congressman Bill Young, US Congressman Allen Boyd, State Representative Bev
Kilmer. We will arrange a meeting with SOCOM in January 2002 to help bring
this project to closure.

Enclosed is a presentation we made to the  Apalachee Regional Planning
Council in July.

Marla thank you for your time, and again I want to thank Dr. Dana and Brett
for there time.

Very Respectfully,

I followed up with Scott Douglas, FEMA, today.  They located request on
Friday and need to run it through their "RRR?" before it goes to Mr.
Albaugh.  However, Albaugh knows of issue and is expecting it to cross his
desk for approval.  I understand Dept of Labor has been calling FEMA to
follow-up (Karen is doing us right!).

I have spoken to both Karen Miller (DOL) and Scott Douglas (FEMA).  Both
were very helpful and hopefully can assist--at least they want to.  We'll
let you know shortly if the assistance is approved.  Thanks for the help.

Do you have any good contacts at US Dept of Labor?  We are looking at a
president declaration which would allow fisherman/sole proprietors
affected by Red Tide to receive disaster unemployment insurance.

I talked to Larry re the following.  Larry does have a lot of experience
and a very good relationship with the USDOL.  Pursuant to that
conversation - he and I both think that if you or any other member of
the Gov's staff have good contacts in the USDOL, it would be more than
appropriate to use them, and quickly.  We would not want this to drag
out for a long time and based on my observation of situations in the
past - a Presidential Declaration in this case is far from a sure thing
without some assistance.

As you know, REACT was asked to assist in gathering information on the
impact of Red Tide on oyster harvesters in the Apalachicola Bay area.
This information would then be used to help substantiate a request for a
Presidential Declaration. As discussed in the conference call today,
Linda Heiberger of DCA had previously contacted Andy Gill of USDOL
regarding Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA).  

In my  conversation with Andy on today, he could not recall an instance
where DUA had been approved in the past in response to  Red Tide. Andy
specifically mentioned that he worked with North Carolina officials for
over a two-year period with Red Tide and their request was never
approved.  However,  Andy did imply that the situation maybe somewhat
different here in Florida and encouraged us to continue with submitting
the request.  At this point, my assessment is that we will need the
support of your office and the Florida Congressional Delegation to
obtain federal approval for DUA.  We are virgously gathering information
to support the declaration request. However,  I wanted to share the
results of my conversation with Andy prior to the Thursday Town Hall
meeting.

Thanks.

* SCHOOL CHOICE: Let the debate begin! The U.S. Supreme Court has scheduled oral arguments for February 20, 2002, at 10:00 a.m., to hear Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, also known as the Cleveland school choice case.  The high Court will determine whether the program, currently helping roughly 4,000 Cleveland children escape chronically failing schools through scholarships at participating private schools, can continue.  CER was joined in filing an amicus, or "friend of the Court," brief by 27 other groups, organizations and individuals, representing tens of thousands of interested parents and civic, community and elected leaders.  The brief urges the Court to consider the context in which the program was enacted  25 years of failed education reform and only one of multiple educational options created by the state of Ohio  in determining whether lawmakers acted constitutionally to fulfill their mandate of providing a fair and equitable education to all children.  At least 20 other groups representing a bipartisan convergence of governors, mayors, attorneys general, legislators, scholars and civil liberties groups filed separate briefs in support of the program, as did the U.S. Solicitor General.

To view CER's brief, go to http://www.edreform.com/press/2001/amicus2001.pdf 

* HELPING HANDS: Valley Academy in Phoenix, AZ is a K-12 college-prep charter school in its fifth year of successful operation, with consistent test score increases from year to year.  It is one of the top performing public schools in the state.  Seventh-grader Adam Shali has been nominated for the second time as a "People to People" student ambassador for Summer 2002.  The program, founded in 1963 by Dwight Eisenhower, teaches young people leadership skills, goal setting, planning, teamwork and more.  Adam couldn't afford to attend with his delegation to the U.K. last year.  This year, the Australia trip is also out of reach.  Why is this a reform issue?  Well, in most traditional public schools and districts, money is allocated to assist participation in these programs.  But charter schools are traditionally on tight, if not sub-par, budgets.  If anyone wants to help Adam, email us at cer@edreform.com.

* CHARTERS:  Charter schools in Florida are embracing new accountability that will require schools in operation for at least one year and serving not less than 30 students to be graded based on their FCAT scores.  The move is a result of the path-breaking A+ Plan which since 1999 has been grading schools based on state test scores and allowing children in persistently failing schools to go to a school of their choice.  Charter operators welcomed the move.  Said one colleague, :If I walk into a legislator's office, drop on the desk a list of charter schools and how they are performing compared to other schools, the legislator will be more receptive than if I say, "Trust me.'"  Last year, the Pembroke Pines elementary and middle charter schools were rewarded for their "A" performance with bonuses of nearly $100,000.  They were two of seven charter schools in the state to receive money for high achievement and this was the first year that any charter school has been recognized.  Not only will charters have to test now, but the public will be able to make meaningful judgements about their performance as well.

* URBAN TROUBLES: California officials poised to allow Compton, CA to run its own school affairs again may want to think twice before allowing the district to discover good education on its own.  While the eight-year long state takeover forced debt to be eliminated, the schools are still among the worst in the state.  The benefit of takeovers normally is that the bureaucracy and corruption that pervades many cities is uncovered and at least partially eliminated to allow for the resolution of things like bad plumbing and inadequate textbook supplies.  Unfortunately, such state intervention rarely, if ever, results in educational improvement.  California leaders may want to consider the more dramatic moves being pushed in Philly, or even nearby Chester, PA where the state's intervention resulted in new schools being set up and much-needed choices among at least a small number of children.  Or they could consider the lessons of Florida or Milwaukee, where varied school choice programs rippled throughout the otherwise complacent system and forced a response that while slow, was steady.

     * UNIONS:  Many local unions are fighting over power and money while all around them, educational problems persist. 

     *In Clark County, NV, the Teamsters and the Nevada State Education Association, an NEA affiliate, are battling it out over who will represent support workers. 

     *Teachers in Middletown, NJ last week went on strike and the Superior Court Judge ordered them back to work.  When they didn't go back, he called each teacher, in alphabetical order, before the bench and told them to go back to work.  If they refused, they were to be sent to jail.  By Thursday night, 228 teachers were jailedabout a quarter of the staff.  The New York Times reported that, "Many of the teachers made impassioned speeches about willingness to suffer the consequences of their defiance, their love of the job and their contempt for Board of Education leaders."  Three teachers resigned or retired in the courtroom rather than face jail time.  The strike ended Friday afternoon, and the two sides are currently entering into negotiations.

     *Worth Repeating: New York Mayor Rudoph Giuliani accused the teachers union of risking grave damage to the city by seeking a 22 percent wage hikedespite the city's budget deficit following the September 11 tragedy.  Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, responded that the union was making the same demands as before the terrorist attack, and accused Mr. Giuliani of exploiting the tragedy to avoid paying teachers. 

FEDERAL POLICY:  After months of bickering, robust debate and negotiation, a House-Senate conference committee working on the education bill is completing work on an agreement that institutes yearly testing  though what and how is left to the states  some additional flexibility for states (though not as much as many would have liked), and flexibility for teacher quality programs.  Timing for final passage in both the House and the Senate is still being worked out.

Dear Jeb,
 
One of your aides requested additional information on the Industrial Incubator project in Century Florida.
 
I have attached a letter of explaination with documentary references that should help, and the Organizational & Management Plan outline.  There are volumes of information and spreadsheet work available on this project, far too much to send unless absolutely necessary.  I have been very close to this project since 1997.  We have fought long and hard for it.  It is worthy.  It is valuable.  It will do good.  
 
You know the Moran's "FIGHT ON".  Please do what you can, or tell me what you need to release the funding from the Dept. of Agriculture on this project -- PLEASE.
 
This is not a fly-by-night deal here (in the "turkey" sense.
 
Thank you, and Merry Christmas!  (*I know your father is VERY proud of G.W. . . . we sure are!  The Bush's are Warrior's too.)

We need to prioritize our calls to Homeland Security.  They are totally
overwhelmed.  Are you familiar with Larry Mixon?  Tim----are you familiar

It could be viewed as bad news. Pax River is the number one competitor with
NAWC/TSD for Navy simulation dollars. Any new programs that strengthens Pax

 SEOS Limited has recently won a $1.5m contract with the US Navy to supply
them with an 11     
 foot radius PANORAMA display, for their reconfigurable simulator program at
the Naval Air     
 Warfare Centre, Patuxent River, Maryland. The project will prove to be a
challenge as the     
 simulator is to be installed on the second floor of the building in a room
only slightly      
 larger than the display, and will accommodate six interchangeable cockpits
ranging from       
 helicopter to fast jet.

Delta is considering offer to leave Dade and relocate in Broward (big local

utilizing our incentives.  However, individual county can use their own $$$
to entice.  If Broward is successful, I would think this would cause extreme

Excellent on dinner...go and make good!!!   Most agree that decision will be made in next couple of weeks.
 
On items one through three:  1 and 2 good.  Number 3 is inherently explosive in that a down-graded status (as sub-ordinated under homeland command) will effectively say to Latin/So. Am region, that they aren't important enough to merit a command of their own (as other regions are afforded worldwide).  Could cause more problems than not w/ our state/national relationships.  Also, the mission addressing this region should be treated distinct and separate from a "homeland" defense mission.

Hi Pam: 

Just to follow up on some matters and/or issues that we discussed during our meeting: 

1. Both Don and I agree with you that the Southcom issue needs to be a State Issue, not a local issue.  Since we do not have the contacts with these legislators in north Florida, we were hoping that you are making initial contact with them regarding the Resolution as well as the overall Southcom issue. 

2. You were going to get back with us about the Governor's intent for the telephone conference scheduled for Monday at 0930.  We want to be sure to be fully prepared with whatever he wants, needs, expects, etc. 

3.  Stanley Tate met with Karl Rove over the weekend and when Stanley brought the Southcom issue up to him (according to Stanley) Rove knew nothing about the matter. That is somewhat distressing to us. Stanley provided him with the limited information that he had and tried to give him the thumbnail sketch of the issues. 

4. In case you have not seen it, I am faxing to you the Dec 17th Newsweek article and an article from "Inside the Pentagon." It gets real interesting at the bottom of page 3. 

Respectfully, 
Lettie Bien

We had no daily press calls from the Department of Children & Families.
Other Issues:
* Draft of an op ed for the Miami Herald et al regarding the Bonnie L/Judge
Moreno editorial.
* An outside attorney from Miami has informed us that she is writing a
response to the Miami Herald. She was particularly disturbed about the
attack on Judge Moreno's character.
* We are also lining up appearances on a couple of public affairs TV shows

dot the state.
* The district is preparing an oped for the Sun Sentinel to respond to an
editorial about "contracts." We will have a copy of the oped before it goes

* Fairly decent coverage in the Miami Herald of a tele  press conference

CORRECTION
* We've asked for and expect to see a correction in the Tampa Tribune about
the community-based care initiatives in the SunCoast region. They
incorrectly reported that Sarasota-Manatee was the only CBC model up and

Yeah, we've been working on it.

Virginia is the model that was used at the Base Commanders Meeting.  We were
able to get the details of their program.  Unfortunately, the Virginia plan
isn't viable here.  There are too many structural differences in our
organizations and balance sheets to make it work.  (For example, they have
the resources to do a full faith and credit general obligation bond issue.
We don't.)

We're exploring other structural options.  Part of the problem is today's
interest rate environment.  The conventional market is offering very low
mortgage rates right now, and we can't do much better.  Also, the yield
curve is incredibly steep.  That means that we are likely to incur
considerable negative arbitrage expenses on any money that we push out.
This wasn't a problem 18 months ago but is huge right now.

I'm sorry that we don't have any more specifics yet, but this is a hard math
problem.

We're still trying to find the answer.

Nina, this is what Colleen and I have been talking about for awhile.  The effort is being headed up by folks at NAS Coastal Systems to utilize unused capacity on base--to include mock-up ships.  Coast Guard (Adm Thad Allen) and Navy leadership both agree Center is best suited in Florida as proposed. However, there is apparently a Virginia legislator who also wants the Center designation and funding.  Some have also mentioned that perhaps a Mississippi Legislator does too.   There is no place in the nation that has the stronghold on this industry.  WE COULD OWN IT!!!  I have a vision.  (Governor/Kathleen, this is effort Gen Kostelnik can lead!)
 
On background, the Center is part of the Panhandle's effort to become Center of Excellence for training Counter-Terrorism/Security/Special Ops.  It is a realistic and very appropriate industry niche for the region.  We should and do want to support.  Aside from companies located in the Panhandle specifically working in this arena--e.g., Intelligence gathering, IT innovations, developing simulations for training, R&D on unmanned vehicles/submarines, there are varied programs either being proposed or already in place to support special ops, counter-terrorism, security training.  Following are a few:
 
Center for Coastal and Maritime Security--being proposed for NAS Coastal Systems in Panama City (In cooperation w/ private sector, Navy would run coastal/maritime counter-terrorism & related security program--for both local and federal law enforcement, coast guard, military, etc.--to train in real-life situations utilizing unused capacity on base (to include resident ships).  They are complimentary to other related training proposed or existing in the Panhandle--and are in discussion w/ them on how to coordinate efforts.  They are complimentary to other related training proposed or existing in the Panhandle.
 
Gulf Assistance Maritime Assistance Center (G-MAC)--Blountstown--Negotiations in final stages-- (Private sector training for special ops--SOCOM, Seals, etc.)  The company is in negotiations with the Dep CINC at SOCOM to bring special operations training to Blountstown Center.  They already have been training BLM law enforcement.  They have acquired a vacant facility--in tact with "kill rooms" and airline storage--for training.  Gov met with team that wants to do.  I brought Commissioner Moore, Steve Lauer, DEP, and others together last week to discuss with the company their plans.   STRICOM has developed significant simulation programs for them and sees this as a big-time
 
Eglin Air Force Base Special Ops Training--Currently Fully Operational--Trains Special Ops in swamps of Eglin.  Army Ranger Training there.
 
Hurlburt AFB--Ft Walton Beach--Air Force Special Operations Headquarters
 
NAS Pensacola--Spacial Orientation Training (underwater special operations training).

Team, 
 
Larry Mixon, Newport News, VA,  has called our office a few times to speak with Stephanie and Bill.  Bill has met with him.  He is seeking our help in contacting Governor Ridge to urge him to establish a "Center for Coastal and Maritime Security" in Panama City.  We understand from Cabinet Affairs that the Governor is interested in the proposal.  
 
On our own homeland security issues, we would like to get Tim/Steve Lauer in to see Ridge's senior staff on 03 funding.
 
We need to prioritize our calls to Homeland Security.  They are totally overwhelmed.  Are you familiar with Larry Mixon?  Tim----are you familiar with the proposal?  Should we push buttons?  Mixon is coming in Thursday morning to meet with us.

As part of this strategery, I would like to request Charles Canady's help on

The Governor has been a strong advocate for charter schools and charter
districts...schools are freed from bureaucratic regulations which allows for
innovated ideas while still holding districts and schools accountable.  The
charter school law was passed prior to the Governor taking office (1995 or
1996).  He did advocate and lobby for its passage as chariman of the
Foundation for Florida's Future.  The charter districts law was passed in
1999 and the Governor was a catalyst

At the past Cafe I heard you speak on the Choice and Control pilot project.  My son Kent Pearson is a participate in this program and I was on the committee to set up the pilot for our District in the Tallahassee area.  I understand this project is to be cut either part or whole in the budget the legislators have given to you for signing.  I urge you to line item veto this.  The nursing agency can not staff our case full time, my wife had to quit work to fill the gaps.  This project has been able to help make up some of this lost income.  We are a family of four living on just 24,000.00 a year.  As a state worker even that is in question.  With the project we have been able to get items my son has needed for years to help him live at home with the family.  I could go on, but I know time is as important to you as it to me.  If I can help in anyway to keep this project alive contact me at 443-7015 this is a Tallahassee number.  Thank you,  Shawn Pearson

Tallahassee, Florida 32399

 

Dear Governor Bush,

 

Recently, the Department of Environmental Protection of the State of Florida denied a permit for the Parks Department to run the Ella Star Casino gambling boat out of Haulover Park.

 

Public records indicate that the County obtained the submerged land by misleading the State about the use of the land, which was not intended for public purposes.

 

With the DEPs recent order, its possible that the County may face legal action from Alpha Hospitality, the company operating the Ella Star for breach of contract.  According to Alphas quarterly reports, the Ella Star has not been profitable since it began operating out of the park, even before the September 11 disaster.  In response to decreased tourist traffic, the Ella Star ceased operations in mid-November.  They may now have a perfect exit strategy, however, evidence exists that they were working in direct cooperation with the Parks Department to deceive the public. Through their mismanagement, the Parks Department and the County have placed an unfair burden on the public with their ridiculous Redevelopment Plan by executing a lease that was illegal.

  

I believe it is in the best interests of the public that further permits for this Redevelopment be suspended or revoked until a full inquiry can be made.  It is becoming increasingly evident that the Parks Department at this point cannot be trusted to pursue what is in the publics best interest.  Your offices continued vigilance and intervention is greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,

Dear Gvernor Bush:

As legislator, a taxpayer, and a concerned citizen, I have always done my 
best to support good education and to help as best I can, efforts to improve 
our childrens future through education.

Suffice to say, many children are dropping-out of the public education 
system and complicating their individual lives and the collective lives of 
our society as a whole.

What to do about it?  Well, thousands of our citizens and corporations have 
joined together in the operation of Community in Schools (CIS), one of the 
most successful dropout prevention and mentoring programs in the entire 
country. 

CIS is a program with documented success in keeping kids in school, bettering 
their grades, and providing avenues for good outcomes in young lives. I have 
been constructively critical of our public school system for many years, yet, 
in that same time frame, I have dedicated much time and effort to the 
implementation and expansion of CIS throughout Florida because of the 
positive results and because something has to be done to provide a helping 
hand to many of our young people who dont fit the square pegs and round 
holes of the education system. 

I have been on the Board of Directors of CIS for over 16 years, beginning 
when I was a member of the Legislature, and later serving two terms as the 
State Chairman. I know CIS and I know how it performs. I know the community 
and the business world responds to CIS and its efforts. And I know that 
without CIS we are going to lose a lot of young people.

Last year the State of Florida cut the CIS budget by $2 million, leaving its 
many programs around the state floundering and trying to survive.  The 
Special Session cut an additional $500,000 for the CIS budget item. There is 
no way this incredibly successful program can survive this cut.

Please consider a veto of item 4B in the Special Session budget and at least 
give CIS a chance to hold itself together until efforts can be made to 
restore the needed financial support.

Sincerely,

Frank S. Messersmith

Subject:	Recommended Veto Items

Dear Governor,

You will recall that I sent an E-mail to you last week urging you to veto
line items 570 and 189B of the Legislative Appropriation Act that resulted
from the most recent Special Legislative Session.  I understand that a
substitute amendment was offered late in the legislative process that may
make the veto of line item 570 no longer necessary.

However, Governor, I would still urge you to veto line item 189B.  I have
enumerated the following points to assist you in your decision making
process:

    The language in the implementing Act, 4C, Section 5 cancels the
existing
procurement for the development and operation of a 600 bed facility for the
treatment of sexually violent predators

    This cancellation limits the ability of your office and the state to
secure the best, most cost effective solution to the housing and treatment
of this growing, dangerous population.

    The issues regarding the procurement or the best approach to dealing
with
the housing and treatment of the population were never debated in
legislative Committee nor were they discussed in Conference.

    The process whereby this occurred does not suggest government in the

Dear Governor,

You will recall that I sent an E-mail to you last week urging you to veto
line items 570 and 189B of the Legislative Appropriation Act that resulted
from the most recent Special Legislative Session.  I understand that a
substitute amendment was offered late in the legislative process that may
make the veto of line item 570 no longer necessary.

However, Governor, I would still urge you to veto line item 189B.  I have
enumerated the following points to assist you in your decision making
process:

    The language in the implementing Act, 4C, Section 5 cancels the
existing
procurement for the development and operation of a 600 bed facility for the
treatment of sexually violent predators

    This cancellation limits the ability of your office and the state to
secure the best, most cost effective solution to the housing and treatment
of this growing, dangerous population.

    The issues regarding the procurement or the best approach to dealing
with
the housing and treatment of the population were never debated in
legislative Committee nor were they discussed in Conference.

    The process whereby this occurred does not suggest government in the

Governor, 

As you noted, Article 8, Section 5, passed in 1998, allows any county to require a 3-5 day waiting period, and background check, for the sale of any firearm on property with public access, including gun shows.  [Other Florida law under Section 790.065, requires all licensed dealers to utilize background checks throughout the state. 790.0655 requires a 3-day waiting period between the purchase and the delivery at retail of any handgun.] 


We have learned that Broward, Volusia, Orange, Dade [informed by contact person,] Sarasota [informed by contact person,] Palm Beach, and Hillsborough  have opted in under the 1998 amendment that allows requiring waiting periods for gun sales, regardless of the nature or location of the sale. Each county may differ regarding whether they use the 1998 amendment to regulate all firearms or just handguns, whether they require a 3 or 5 day waiting period, etc. Orange and  Volusia limit their ordinances to handguns, even though they could cover all guns.  We are checking on other counties and have an information request into the Association of Counties. 

I don't believe there are lot more than these. One source said there are about seven counties that have opted in.

My Dear Jeb , 

As the polls show, your economic recovery efforts are falling behind the curve and you have yet to deal with the 2.1 Billion more in cuts that you will be addressing in the next regular legislative session. 

May I suggest that you consider going with the ADM and Democrats plans for Ethanol as a viable economic solution to diversity in the Fla revenue market? 

I previously sent to you and your staff the synfuel developments of an out of state corportation using garbage and plasma conversion to produce syn fuels and destroy toxic waste. 

You really should pay more attention to these new revenue sources. 

I would be more than happy to speak with you but not your subordinates directly on this. Or perhaps  send you some additional information on the idea of using the Fla sunshine to produce alternative. fuels and electrical power for growth and production of drinking water. 

Or you can work on a plan to explain to Fla voters why Fla prisions are being emptied of violent criminals, medicade is being cut back, mentally ill are roaming the streets and the overcrowded and unsafe fire trap state schools rank 50 out of 50 in state funding behind all other states. 

Don't forget the promised statewide water shortages and the high levels of  unemployment and school/ university over crowding current and projected.

Hi Pam: 

Just to follow up on some matters and/or issues that we discussed during our meeting: 

1. Both Don and I agree with you that the Southcom issue needs to be a State Issue, not a local issue.  Since we do not have the contacts with these legislators in north Florida, we were hoping that you are making initial contact with them regarding the Resolution as well as the overall Southcom issue. 

2. You were going to get back with us about the Governor's intent for the telephone conference scheduled for Monday at 0930.  We want to be sure to be fully prepared with whatever he wants, needs, expects, etc. 

3.  Stanley Tate met with Karl Rove over the weekend and when Stanley brought the Southcom issue up to him (according to Stanley) Rove knew nothing about the matter. That is somewhat distressing to us. Stanley provided him with the limited information that he had and tried to give him the thumbnail sketch of the issues. 

4. In case you have not seen it, I am faxing to you the Dec 17th Newsweek article and an article from "Inside the Pentagon." It gets real interesting at the bottom of page 3.

Dear Governor Bush:

       With all that is going on in the Great State of Florida, the Nation, and the World I will try to keep this e-mail brief.  In your speech to the Florida League of Cities Downtown Redevelopment Seminar held in Miami you stated that your e-mail is one of the best ways to get in touch with you.
       As an elected official I know first hand how hard it is to keep track of everything that is going on.  However, when I feel someone is treated improperly I work hard to rectify the situation.  
       You can imagine how hard it is to survive as a small business man these days.  As if the economy were not bad enough, one of your agencies is causing me unnecessary problems.  I submitted an application to the Department of Business and Professional Regulation, Board of Funeral Directors and Embalmers to open a new cinerator (crematory) facility.  In my twenty-one years in this profession I have received one minor complaint which currently pending against me.  The Departments Legal Advisor (Charles Tunnicliff) has specifically stated to my attorney that the staff of the Department is improperly using a statute to deny my final inspection.  I invested $100,000.00 in the construction and equipment for the cinerator facility.  I hired two additional staff members to operate the facility.  When I made application to the Department in May/2001 I was told my inspection would take place in 30 days.  Well, its now December and I have been forced to sell the crematory at a loss, I have suffered tens of thousands of dollars in lost income, and I am being forced to terminate the two employee's.  As if that were not enough, the Department is denying my request to have my $400.00+ application fee refunded.  They have taken no action on my application.  I should at least be entitled to a refund of my application fee.  
       Again, (in summary) I lose a new business venture, I lose tens of thousands of dollars in income, I am adding two more people to the unemployment lines, and I can't even get my lousy 400+ dollars back.  Needless, to say I am appalled at the Departments handling of this matter.
       Governor Bush, I believe you are a sincere, honest man, who cares a lot about all of us.  I support you and all that you have tried to do to downsize and limit government spending.  I have been one of your most outspoken supporters in local and statewide political circles.  Of course having the former Chairwoman of the Brevard Republican Executive Committee as a mother; in her eyes Republicans can do no wrong (especially a Bush)!  Please take this matter under consideration.  I want to continue to be in your corner as we go into this election year.  I need your help!  Persons working for you should promote commerce and the economy not help tear it down.

Subject:	UF Commencement thoughts

Governor --

Here's an update.

I.  Things I already know about the address:
-- 10-12 minutes
-- President Charles Young will intro you
-- there will be six students (student leader of the year) etc on the dias
with you
-- about 1500 students total will be in attendance

II.  Things I'm getting info on:
-- the breakdown of the 1500 and what schools (Arts & Sciences, Accounting,
etc.) they're getting their degrees from
-- what these six students did to merit recognition (their personal stories)
-- also other grads with personal stories we can use to illustrate our
points

III.  Themes for you to consider (Governor -- please reply so I know which
of these if any I should be developing)

Option A:  September 11th as a catalyst for a renewed sense of purpose
-- for our nation
-- for each of you graduates
-- education expands your abilities, but it cannot give you purpose
-- purpose comes from realizing that you are special, that you have energy
and talent (refined by education) to contribute, that the world can and must
be changed
-- theme to the grads:  you have the potential to be the next Greatest
Generation.  And we need one.

Option B:  Your Personal Vision on a Key Issue
-- this would be a more personal look at one key issue you've addressed
since you took office
-- less why it is important for Florida, and more why it is important to you
-- perhaps how your ideas have changed on it as it's been implemented
-- the theme being for the grads that you have to stick to your vision, be
able to take criticism while also being flexible and taking advantage of new
opportunities
-- policy areas you could address here:  One Florida (I know at UF would be
controversial, all the more reason to do ir), Developmentally Disabled, the
Everglades, A+ Plan

Option C:  Enjoy what you do
-- tell a bunch of stories that illustrate how much fun it is to be
Govenror, to be you
-- to poke fun at yourself and politics in general
-- not an irreverent speech at all but something a little more lighthearted
-- the theme for the graduates would be relish what you do, laugh at
yourself, it can actually help you be more productive by not taking yourself
so seriously
-- if you choose this option, I'll talk to Slater and Chris Clarke and have
them give me the Top Five Funny Governor stories
-- also your thoughts on the more light-hearted moments you've enjoyed as
Governor
-- one story I know about is the story of Shakespeare the bird from last
year's SOS (died recently, did you see the letter), how it caught your eye
on the video and you wanted to find out more about the bird and the couple
(Jerry and Jeanne Price)

Governor, those are three broad themes.  Please let me know which one you'd
like me to pursue or if I should start from scratch with a few more options.

-- Mark

P.S.  Kathleen, any thoughts?

Dear Governor;
 
I know how busy you are in these difficult times, and I apologize, in advance, for disturbing you.  But I know you have said many times how concerned you are about kids, especially seriously ill kids. 
 
Stormy Burn is a 13 year old wheelchair bound quadriplegic.  He is now bedridden and in severe pain at Florida Hospital East in Orlando.  You met Stormy last year concerning the Medically Essential Utility Law.  He was in Tallahassee with the other families.
 
Stormy's mother, Katie, pleaded with the Children's Medical Service to put a feeding tube in Stormy because he was not getting enough nourishment by mouth and he was losing weight.  Stormy was down to 61 pounds and his mother was afraid that his bones were going to become brittle, as they often do, with these children.  It took a year, and her having to sit on the floor in the emergency room of the hospital and threaten not to leave until they put the feeding tube in him.  The doctors at C.M.S. finally decided to do so.  By this time, the child's bones have gotten so brittle, that every time they move him they are afraid of breaking his bones.  Are they not suppose to be helping these families?
 
Stormy started to feel pain in his body and a fracture showed up on a scan that was done by an emergency room doctor. A cast was put on, and the doctor told the mother it would have to stay on for about 4 weeks.  When Mrs. Burn went to the Children's Medical Services Doctors at Nemourse Clinic at Arnold Palmer,
she was told he did not need to keep the cast on and they removed it.  They strongly refused to replace the cast.  Dr. Phillips and his associate, Dr. Burnbaum, twisted the childs foot and leg in so many directions that they made him cry and yell.  Stormy has not been the same.  He was sent home in constant pain and was told by Bernice, the Orthopedic Nurse, that they do not address pain management and not to bring him in for pain. He was bedridden and without any medication to help relieve his pain.  His mother and older brother could not turn him or touch him without him crying in pain. They have given him an appointment in January to see an Orthopedic doctor.  This is ridiculous.  Stormy is presently at Florida Hospital East and is on heavy pain medication.  He may have a bone infection, and they have found a fracture in his right ankle.  He may be sent home again without pain medication by Dr. Goetz, another C.M.S practitioner.  Animals are treated better!
 
Stormy's mother and brother have dedicated their lives to Stormy.  Their lives are centered upon him and his needs.  It is very frustrating to them and frightening not to be able to trust the doctors they need to help Stormy.
 
I have had many experiences with the Children's Medical Services  over my 18 years helping these families, and I can tell you these families are not treated justly.  The level of care is substandard, to say the least, with personnel who are nasty and vindictive and doctors who haven't a clue to a child's needs.
 
Stormy needs help and he needs it now.  I know they think his mom is a big mouth.  But when you see your child not getting the treatment needed, and you have to wait a year for treatment, my patience would run out too.  More parents have to speak up and not be afraid of retribution.  
 
I am asking, before something else goes wrong with Stormy Burn, for your assistance in getting this child and other children like him assistance before it is too late.  This child will die if he does not get the proper attention.
 
The Children's Medical Service is another example of a good idea gone bad.  It is a waste of money and energy.  Bernice, the Orthopedic Nurse, needs to find another profession and so do some of the doctors Mrs. Burn has had to deal with.
 
Respectfully,
 
Tony Giorgio, President
Compassion Children's Foundation

Relatively good news on the Jim Williams front.  First, on the SBA loan, he
wasn't exactly denied SBA loan--but he refused to  put up home or business
property as collateral (as required by SBA).  SBA would give him loan IF he
put up property (however, his family opted against). 

Second, Jim is selling Discover Air to Chalks Airline (owned by Onyx
insurance).  Chalks Airline provides amphibious flights to the Keys and
Bahamas and they are purchasing Discover Air so that they can fly regular
flights and land on air strips (rather than land just on water).  Jim and
his sons are swapping Discover Air for a third of the Chalks Airline stock.
And with that stock, Jim will have the opportunity to be the COO and
President of the newly formed company.

Thanks to each of you who receive and read this.  We gave it all we had,
but looks like the 9-11 perpetrators have won another one.  I wrote this
letter to George Lane (my friend and mentor in legislative procedure)
this morning and thought each of you had in one way or another been
involved
and I wanted you to know what is happening.

Governor Bush, you have a great young bunch of folks around you there
in Tallahassee and they did all they could to help in this trying time.
 Those folks that make up the Federal agencies just don't know or care
what is happening and I hope when you and your staff move to Washington
in 7 more years you will do what you can to unseat all those whose jobs
were protected, but who didn't feel the need to make sure others receive
adequate help.  Never did we ask for handouts; only long term loans to
help stay in business during the recovery.  They mouth good words, just
short on carry through.  Brett Doster sat with some of us from the
Orlando
area and listen to people 'mouth' platitudes.  I only hope at least some
of those that attended got more attention and help than our little
school.

Thanks again...........

========================================================================
=======
=================================

George,

I'm back from the West Coast and am happy to say things went well out
there.  Now it's time to see what I can do about the problems back here.

While I was gone the SBA has for all practical purposes turned down the
loan application (long term/low interest) for the money to replace
business
lost as a result of 9-11.  They didn't exactly turn it down but said if
we wanted the paperwork to go any farther in the consideration process,
each of my sons and myself must put our homes up as collateral.  We
can't
do that.  If they want personal guarantees that would be different.  You
often have to give those for a loan, but never your house.  We tried to
tell them, 'what would happen if another plane flew into the Sears Tower
in Chicago, and no airline could or would be able to hire new pilots for
several years?'  All of us would not only lose the business, but our
homes
as well and that is unsatisfactory.


They say that is the chance you must take if you want the loan.  So, no
loan!  We are willing to put our personal guarantee up but not our
homes.

If I had to make a guess, we will now lose the Academy, and as you know
have already lost (through selling to a new owner) Discover Air.  In
order
to just meet fixed and certain variable expenses, the academy has to
bring
in 20 new students each month.   Thirteen have been enrolled for the
December
class and the rest (29) withdrew before they even arrived (we now have
over a million dollars in revenue withdrawls since 9-11), so that
accelerates
the end of something really quite good.  There will come a time when the
pilot shortage hits that those folks in Federal programs administration
and those folks we elect to public office will regret that they have
allowed
a whole industry to flounder.  They think that by throwing a 'little'
money at the major airlines who could afford expensive lobbyists, that
they have done something heroic.  I have one trump card to play and
that's
getting airlines that are going to need our services to step up to the
plate and tell the next generation of pilots that there is a future for
them in the airline business.  It may really be too late for Airline
Training
Academy, but maybe some others can get through this period intact.

George, if you have any plans for further involvement with the Academy,
do yourself and us a favor and terminate any time commitment.  There is
not money enough to pay our bills, such as gas, that allow us to
continue
to instruct, let alone your invoice which you would have earned by the
end of December.  We have paid you for October and November but will not
be able to pay anything more.  There is not money for salaries for my
sons and so personal savings will get tapped just to make mortgage
payments
from here on out.  I don't regret paying you the $5,000 in fees for
services,
I just wish that we had known you at a better time when we would have
benefited more from your association.

George, even though we won't be able to have a professional association,
we are still 'brothers in Christ'.  I wish you and Libby a Holy holiday
season and the very best possible in 2002 as things get better, we hope.
 God bless you and your entire family.

Jim

Dear John:
 
It was a pleasure speaking with you regarding Agere Systems and the valued relationship your company maintains with the State of Florida.  The investments Agere has made in business expansions and job creation in Florida has contributed to greatly to our economy.  Equally important has been your companys role as a partner in economic development programsfrom participation in the Florida High Tech Corridor to providing chairs at the University of Central Florida and the University of South Florida.
 
Fully recognizing the difficult times facing your industry, I want to emphasize that Floridas commitment to fostering the growth of technology-based industry clusters remains steadfast.  Florida has partnered with your company in the past, and we are ready to do so again to ensure your continued successparticularly in research and development realms.
 
With a focus on the optoelectronics and photonics, there are particularly unique opportunities for Agere to excel in Florida.  As you may be aware, the University of Central Florida (UCF) is recognized as among the top three schools in the nation (if not world) for optical science and engineering, and its Center for Research and Education in Optics and Lasers (CREOL  www.creol.ucf.edu <http://www.creol.ucf.edu/> ) is in class amongst itself.   Beyond espousing incredible research, UCF and CREOL are producing optoelectronics graduates highly sought in the private sectormany of whom have assumed employment at Agere.  With an obvious shared vision, it would seem very advantageous for UCF to work closely with Agere Sytems to build upon research and development programs that will lead to model innovations.  
 
I have asked John Hitt, UCF President to contact your office to strategize on how UCF and CREOL can best incorporate Agere into its varied research and development programs.   Perhaps this could include relocation of some of Ageres optoelectronics programs presently based in New Jersey.  From both a vantage of academic excellence and financial feasibility, I am confident that Florida could greatly benefit Agere Systems in its continued growth plans.
 
Until then, I wish you all the best and welcome you to contact me whenever I might be of assistance.
 
Sincerely,
 
 
Jeb Bush

Subject:	Budget Cuts

Dear Governor Bush, 

The Special Session Budget being presented to you includeds Senate and House recommendations to reduce Communities In Schools (CIS) funding by another 50% of the promised allocation for this year.  This is  disproportionate cut for CIS.  We lost 2/3 of our funding this year and while most child services organizations received cuts that were significantly less than ours-many cuts came from increases granted in last year's session.  Programs in Miami are in jeopardy.  Our students are greatly in need of psychological services that, at best, are difficult to secure.  If we should lose the people who seek services for students they will suffer great emotional harm.  Our students are already hurting emotionally from home problems they cannot overcome by themselves.  If you could only see the look of relief on students faces after they receive professional counseling at school or hear comments from students who have the chance to be heard by a trained Listener you would understand the need for services provided by CIS.  As we try to prepare students for the "real world" of work and challenges of overcoming daily obstacles we cannot overlook the fact that they need social and emotional help to keep them in school.  One of our students lost her mother last week and is taking care of her blind father.  Another student lost both parents last year when his father killed his mother and then himself.  Another student has been abandoned by his parents, his guardian lives in Georgia, and he is living with a cousin in south Miami-Dade County.These students need the small class size, caring individuals in their lives, emotional support, counseling, focus on careers, mentoring and tutoring that CIS offers.  We are the family our students don't have.  Please veto budget line item 4.

Cyber Citizens For Justice Dispatch - Distribute Widely -

Dear members and friends, 
 
A markedly different bill filed by Senator Steven Geller has emerged from committee hearings in Tallahassee and appears headed for enactment once the companion bill Hb 177 filed by Rep. Sobel is considered prior to and/or during the upcoming 2002 Legislative session. 
 
* SEE BELOW * 
 
Regardless, the amended bill seems to casts doubt on the ability of residents of deed restricted communities to install a FLAGPOLE in their front, side or rear yard or a bracket on the front of their condominium without a fight from the community HOA. 
 
Neither of these perogatives were included when the bill was heard and approved unanimously in committee. Possibly, it isn't necessary? Review and decide for yourselves. 
 
NOTE: While the bill can be retrieved in .html or .pdf format, Adobe Acrobat software is required to read the analysis. In time, both will be available for review at our Web site. 
 
Your comments and suggestions are appreciated. Thank you.

Confirmed authors for the Naples event:

*	Al Roker (Morning Show Fame and author of Don't Make Me Stop This Car: Adventures in Fatherhood)  Will also do the community event in the morning with children. 

*	Michael Beschloss (historian; just came out with new book on Lyndon Johnson) 

*	Al Smith ( Ophra's chef and author of Back to the Table: the Reunion of Food and Family)...Governor - Al is thrilled!  Says, "Thank you!" and will be cooking the lunch for everyone as well as reading.

Question:  We have an opportunity to perhaps also include Dr. Suess's wife - I thought it might appeal to the Naples' crowd; however, I know that Mr. Beschloss uses oral tape and therefore may go a bit long.  Do you both have opinions on whether we should keep it at these three authors or expand to include Dr. Suess's wife?
 
Also, Dr. Robin Cook will join us but will just say a few words at the dinner (only).  Governor, I also talked with Al and I believe we all have an understanding of our roles and should not trip over each others toes.
 
If you open the DRAFT attached advertisement which will run in Gulf Life Shores and the business magazine of southwest Florida, pay NO attention to spelling, grammar, or writing, it is very draft, but does give a nice idea of the ad setup.

Morgan Lewis & Bockius, have contact me in reference to your serving as the 
Honorary Chairman of the Florida Philharmonic Gala on February 2, 2002. 
Unfortunately you are unable to attend as you are keynote at Pinellas LDD. 
If you agree to serve as honorary you would allow them to use your name on 
the invitation and we would prepare a letter to be read at dinner or a 
video. 
Thoughts ?

David wants Gov to drop by ERC meeting at DEP this afternoon.  He has work
and call time at 12.30.  Not so sure . . .  Although Denver just called to
say that meeting is going very well.

Governor:
I thought you would appreciate a brief update (since youve already asked) on how our web link with FLAUSA is producing.
Also, the point of sale material is now in retailer locations across our state, were shooting the TV spot this week in West Palm, and I signed off on the final version of the instant ticket artwork yesterday. 
Finally, in addition to Carnival, Emerald Coast, Kennedy Space Center, Sea World and Universal, we have added the Miami Seaquarium to our list of primary partners on this project.

Subject: Hot Vacation Deals/flalottery.com link exchange
 
Secretary Griffin,
 
Good morning.  I have great news about the Florida Hot Vacation Deals/flalottery.com link exchange program I want to share with you.
 
Just as a reminder, from 11/1/01, the first day of our link exchange program, through 11/8/01, flalottery.com sent an average of 155 visitors a day to the Hot Vacation Deals web site, for a total of approximately 1,240 visitors during that time period.
 
This morning, Chris Gasparro, of Miles Media, provided me with some updated figures on how much traffic flalottery.com has referred to the Hot Vacation Deals web site.  The news is very good!
 
Here are the details:
 
*	From 11/9/01 through 12/6/01, flalottery.com has sent a total of 4,162 visitors to the Hot Vacation Deals web site.
*	From 11/9/01 through 12/6/01, flalottery.com is sending a daily average of 148 visitors to the Hot Vacation Deals web site.
*	Our highest daily total referrals occurred 11/25/01, when flalottery.com sent Hot Vacation Deals 243 visitors
*	Our lowest daily total referrals occurred on 11/27/01 (the Tuesday after Thanksgiving), when flalottery.com sent Hot Vacation Deals 94 visitors.  This low figure seems to be an anomaly.  I can provide you with detailed daily figures if it would be helpful.
*	So far during December (12/1/01  12/6/01), flalottery.com is sending a daily average of 153 visitors to the Hot Vacation Deals web site.  Please note that this average is remaining relatively constant more than a full month into the link exchange program.
*	As of 8:30 a.m. this morning, 12/7/01, we have sent 15 visitors to the Hot Vacation Deals web site.
 
Other items of interest:  Since we have activated the short button banner on the main page, and added the FLA-USA links to all of our pages, the FLA-USA web site has leapfrogged flalottery.com in the Google search engine rankings for the general search term: florida.  Currently FLA-USA ranks fourth and flalottery.com ranks sixth (before the link exchange, it was the other way around).  Since the Google ranking algorithm considers links to a web site to be a major factor in relevancy, our numerous links to FLA-USA could be a major factor in their improved ranking.
 
In addition, I believe it is significant that the traffic we are sending to the Hot Vacation Deals web site is targeted traffic.  In other words, people arent just surfing on in, but rather are clicking the Hot Vacation Deals link specifically because they are interested in visiting Florida.
 
Please let me know if you have any questions or if I can provide further information or assistance.

Dear Governor Bush:
As well as saying hello, Bill Farley suggested I keep this note to you
brief.
Thanks again for getting me and my colleagues in front of Kim Bahrami and
her staff  theyve been great!
Based on public information about your technology vision for Florida, time
is a critical element.  In the first two U.S. attempts to effect massive
change with regards to the strategic use of technology in government
(Connecticut, and the County of San Diego), even more critical than time was
the direct involvement of the Chief Executive.
My two colleagues from the Law firm of Gordon & Glickson and I would like to
schedule a meeting with you (or, in an effort to get on your schedule
earlier, a phone conference) during which we will brief you on our
experiences in CT and San Diego, as they apply to Florida, particularly
those issues that you must focus on very early, in order to successfully
move forward.
Please have your scheduler contact me by phone or email and I will make the
arrangements with Mark Gordon and Michael Moss to be wherever we need to be
at your option.
Best Regards,

Michael Barton

On December 11th  the three-month anniversary of the September 11th attacks  President George W. Bush is asking states to hold remembrance events and to play the national anthem at the exact moment the first airplane struck the World Trade Center in New York (8:46 a.m. EST).
 
Lt. Governor Brogan and I welcome you to come down to the Capitol Courtyard tomorrow, December 11th, at 8:30 a.m. to participate in Floridas remembrance ceremony.  Supervisors should make every effort to accommodate their employees' desire to attend this service.
 
God Bless America.

I sent this a few weeks ago in response to your announcement about state employees getting an increase.  It was to the "myflorida address" so I don't think you read it.  Here is the text of the message:
 
Dear Governor,

I am in the private sector, providing rehabilitative services for juvenile
offenders.  While I am happy that DJJ workers are getting another COLA
increase I felt that you should know that providers have not had their
per-diem rates adjusted since 1990.  How long can a business maintain
quality service when the revenue streams remain static?

The company I work for operates two programs at the lowest DJJ per diem
available, $75 per day.  Recent studies put the cost of similar providers in
other states much higher.  Juvenile crime is down, recidivism rates are
down, the private providers in our state have served you well.  What will it
take for you to recognize our work and see to it that we can afford quality
staff to do a most difficult task?  Will recidivism have to climb?  Will
juvenile crime have to increase before you spend some time evaluating
revenue streams that are over a decade old?  Sometimes we feel that we are
simply training people in the industry for the Department of Juvenile
Justice because as soon as they have training and some experience, they can
go to DJJ and work for thousands of dollars more.

I don't want to damper your enthusiasm for your state worker's pay increase,
just wanted to let you know that Christmas for the private providers comes
with little consideration from your office or the office of the department.

Sincerely,

Fast-track teacher training gets new look

By Doug Gross
Times-Union staff writer

ATLANTA-- Georgia's education colleges are giving folks who have lost
their
jobs in the post-Sept. 11 economic slump a chance to rebound -- in the
state's classrooms.

Fifteen Georgia universities announced yesterday a fast-track teacher
training program that will begin this summer and let graduates start
work in
short-handed classrooms across the state in the fall.

Georgia Responds, a revamped version of the state's current alternative
teacher program, is geared to attract college-educated professionals who
may
have been laid off or unable to find other work as the national economy
slides.

"The philosophy is, if you've ever wanted to get into teaching, and fate
has
dealt you a curveball, take another look at it," said Drew Albritton,
executive director of the Georgia Association of Educators, which
opposed
the state's earlier fast-track plan but favors this one.

Paul Beare, dean of the college of education at Armstrong Atlantic State
University in Savannah, said ideas for the statewide plan were developed
during a meeting when university leaders were looking for ways to
respond to
September's terrorist attacks and their aftermath.

"[Now] we're kind of downplaying Sept. 11 because [university officials]
didn't want to make it look like we were piggybacking on that," Beare
said.
"But it was so heartwarming to be able to do something for some of these
people who have lost their jobs."

The program is set to start in June at 15 campuses. Enrollees will get
teacher training throughout the summer.

Albritton's group, which represents nearly 40,000 teachers throughout
the
state, loudly opposed Georgia's current Teacher Alternative Preparation
Program (TAPP), which puts teachers through an intensive course that
lasts
roughly four weeks. A spokesman called teachers churned out by the
program
"four-week wonders," saying the program doesn't prepare them for the
realities of the classroom.

But Albritton said the Georgia Responds program will include more
training
on teaching techniques and other classroom skills, and provide full-time
mentors to help the new teachers adjust.

"The sad part is we could have done it right the first time," he said.
"Since we didn't, I'm glad the deans have taken the initiative."

Beare said he expects his school's version of the program to be almost
twice
as popular as TAPP. Armstrong Atlantic graduated 82 students from the
program this year and expects to enroll about 150 for Georgia Responds.

Statewide, more than 4,000 people applied for TAPP, which began in the
summer. About 750 of them were in classrooms at the beginning of this
school
year.

The Georgia Department of Education estimates there were 900 teaching
jobs
vacant when school started in the fall.

Ah, the panhandle...

"There are some member bills that are not in departments' (budgets), and if
members don't have a way to get their bills and their proposals to the
Legislature, then you don't have a true representative form of government,"

Dear Governor:

Jeb, as you probably know I am on the Brunswick Corporation Board of
Directors.  Last week during our Board Meeting the possible  move of
headquarters to South Carolina came up.  I have spoken with the Chairman
and
CEO - George Buckley about Florida and why this would make sense for
Brunswick.  He informed me that he has spoken with you and the interest
that
the State may have in having Brunswick headquarter in Florida.

If I can be of any assistant in setting up a meeting with George or in
being
of help with any introductions, do not hesitate to let me know.  

For your information our next meeting will be held in Naples, Fl.
February
5th, I would be happy to host a dinner on the 4th or 5th if you think it
would help

Respectfully,

Subject:	Communities In Schools

This e-mail is to ask you to veto budget line item 4 which reflects a reduction in Communities In Schools' budget to $500,000.  As you know Communities In Schools (CIS)  is a stay in school program which provides the five basics a child needs to grow up to be a productive citizen:  a one-on-one relationships with a caring adult, a safe place to learn and grow, a healthy start, a marketable skill upon graduation, and a chance to give back to peers and community.  In many instances, CIS provides one or more of these basics which would otherwise not be available to the child.  In a small rural community like Putnam County, CIS is critical to insure that our children grow up to be educated, healthy adults.  In this county alone, CIS  has the Americorps PutnamWRITES! and PutnamREADS! program which places 36 Members in the elementary schools to provide one on one tutorial assistance to at risk children.  Without funding, these 36 members could disappear - resulting in additional hardship to an already "stressed" school district.    Also, CIS has several mentoring initatives:  A Boy's to Men Connection which pairs young middle school  males with positive male role models as their mentors, an EnvironMentor program which partners science and environmental professionals with students in grades 5-8 to explore career opportunities and Florida's environment, and several other mentoring programs that are in the develpmental stages.  CIS of Putnam believes "a one on one relationship with a caring adult" is fundamental to the success of young people.  Our board is committed to establishing a wide variety of mentoring programs which address the community's resources and the needs of our children.  If CIS is not funded, these programs will likely end.  So much progress is being made to stop now.   

Please consider a veto of this item.  Spending dollars "up front" in our youth will certainly save dollars down the road.

I haven't "bothered" you much lately because I know that you and your
brother have been extremely busy. However, the fire that leveled the IGA in
Carrabelle has caused a difficulty I never expected. The prices at the
convenience stores/gas stations for bread, milk, etc. rose on the very SAME
day of the fire. (Two of these stations were fined after Sept. 11 for
raising gas prices also!) I don't mind...we can drive elsewhere, but there
are a lot of older people in town who don't have that option and could only
get to the IGA by using a golf cart or walking. Is there someone from your
consumer affairs dept. that could look into this for those poor souls?

Governor, Donna asked that I follow up from Saturday's morning briefing regarding vetoes for the special session.  Our unit raised a question over the increase in funding for Farm Share.  Farm Share is separate from the individual food banks which we have not funded.  Farm Share had been receiving $400,000 in recurring GR for the last few years, during the special session, this money was cut and was replaced with $900,000 non-recurring GR.  It is my understanding that Senator Jones pushed for the increased appropriation.  The reason we raised the question is that we believe there may not be the need for this increase.  During last session it was brought to our attention that Farm Share and Patricia Robbins (Executive Director) had been contracting with her son ($100,000 annually) to provide computer assistance to the administration of the program.  After this was discovered I had several conversations with Terry Rhodes and the Dept. of Agriculture and they have since put language into the contract with Farm Share that all monies from the state must be used for the delivery of food.  In addition, it was reported over the summer by the Miami Herald that Farm Share was making a bid to purchase a 1/2 acre lot in Miami for $1 million to establish an Agricultural Museum.  According to DACS there is no need for an Ag Museum and they have a hard enough time keeping open the one Ag Museum currently in existence.  According to my information this is possible because of the sponsors and supporters of Farm Share as well as the investment practices of the non-profit company.  Currently Farm Share has received money from the state as well as 2 full time positions funded by the Dept. of Agriculture for the administration of the program.  In addition DACS provides them space to operate.

Taking all of this into consideration, it was questioned whether or not they needed additional funding.  There would really be 3 options for this issue:

1.  Let the funding go, since it is not recurring, they would be back at the table next session fighting for funding with everyone else.  This would put them on the same level as federal programs (Women, Infant and Children (WIC), Farmer's Market Nutrition Program) which Ag has to come to the table for every year for matching funding.

2.  Veto the funding which would allow them to keep the $400,000 in recurring GR. 
3.  Let the funding go and in the Executive Budget, and eliminate the positions funded by DACS that support the program if they are going to continue to receive such a large appropriation.

Fast-track teacher training gets new look

By Doug Gross
Times-Union staff writer

ATLANTA-- Georgia's education colleges are giving folks who have lost
their
jobs in the post-Sept. 11 economic slump a chance to rebound -- in the
state's classrooms.

Fifteen Georgia universities announced yesterday a fast-track teacher
training program that will begin this summer and let graduates start
work in
short-handed classrooms across the state in the fall.

Georgia Responds, a revamped version of the state's current alternative
teacher program, is geared to attract college-educated professionals who
may
have been laid off or unable to find other work as the national economy
slides.

"The philosophy is, if you've ever wanted to get into teaching, and fate
has
dealt you a curveball, take another look at it," said Drew Albritton,
executive director of the Georgia Association of Educators, which
opposed
the state's earlier fast-track plan but favors this one.

Paul Beare, dean of the college of education at Armstrong Atlantic State
University in Savannah, said ideas for the statewide plan were developed
during a meeting when university leaders were looking for ways to
respond to
September's terrorist attacks and their aftermath.

"[Now] we're kind of downplaying Sept. 11 because [university officials]
didn't want to make it look like we were piggybacking on that," Beare
said.
"But it was so heartwarming to be able to do something for some of these
people who have lost their jobs."

The program is set to start in June at 15 campuses. Enrollees will get
teacher training throughout the summer.

Albritton's group, which represents nearly 40,000 teachers throughout
the
state, loudly opposed Georgia's current Teacher Alternative Preparation
Program (TAPP), which puts teachers through an intensive course that
lasts
roughly four weeks. A spokesman called teachers churned out by the
program
"four-week wonders," saying the program doesn't prepare them for the
realities of the classroom.

But Albritton said the Georgia Responds program will include more
training
on teaching techniques and other classroom skills, and provide full-time
mentors to help the new teachers adjust.

"The sad part is we could have done it right the first time," he said.
"Since we didn't, I'm glad the deans have taken the initiative."

Beare said he expects his school's version of the program to be almost
twice
as popular as TAPP. Armstrong Atlantic graduated 82 students from the
program this year and expects to enroll about 150 for Georgia Responds.

Statewide, more than 4,000 people applied for TAPP, which began in the
summer. About 750 of them were in classrooms at the beginning of this
school
year.

The Georgia Department of Education estimates there were 900 teaching
jobs
vacant when school started in the fall.

Subject:	Concerns regarding Treatment for Florida

Dear Sir:

We have spent many years in the State of Florida trying to build programming
to a level that inmates are able to be rehabilitated, and this hard work by
the State and providers has begun to pay off as proven by the decrease in
crime and drug use.  This is part of your legislative agenda, to reduce drug
use by 50% in the State of Florida.  

How can the State of Florida have money set aside for Faith Based programming
when you are cutting the current programs provided for Department of
Corrections Institutions?  Faith Based programming is a good concept without
the legalities worked out.  Any treatment programming must be licensed by
Department of Children and Families.  This licensing requires qualified
and/or certified professionals.  Most Chaplins do not have these kind of
credentials.  It doesn't make good business to not find the matching funds
necessary to continue your grant funded programming.  Finding $500,000 to
save $2.5m should be a priority of the State.

Please try to identify the funds necessary to continue needed services in our
prison system.  It is in the State's best interest to move the $5m set-aside
for faith based programming to existing programs.  Many families are
dependent upon employment in this field.  Don't cut jobs that are already in
place.

Sincerely,

Sir, some of those who went on the pilot projects were receiving services from General Revenue, and some of the clients were using non med-waiver providers which they will loose, and some where brought into the project that were not receiving any services so that they may receive some sort of service, that they were not getting before, these are the ones that will loose everything.  Again I emplore you to carefully consider all the consequences is these projects are stopped to early.  We are hoping that by the time these projects are finished things will be looking better for the State of Florida financially, so that we can apply these results of these projects to change things for the better.

Good Morning Gov. Bush,
 
 Sir I have heard that you are suppose to make a decision today on whether or not to cut the 3 pilot projects because of the budget crunch.  Sir I implore you to please consider letting these projects finish running their course through June as originally planned.  Stopping them now would from all indications cost the state more in State Funding than it would if they where left in place.  I Say this from experience with the programs.  The people on these programs are saving the State of Florida thousands if not millions in state revenue.  They are making purchases at a much lower cost than the state can at this time for their consumable medical products and durable goods.  They are getting much more for the money that the state provides them than the state can.  They are paying lower rate for repite, companion and personal care because they can hire non-certified family members or friends for these services than having to riley on companies the state hires at a much higher rate.  
  Please consider very carefully because there are some clients on the pilot project that will not be eligible to go back on the Med - Waiver program and will be left eith no support at all except to be place into a state institution which will cost the state three times as much in support.  Thank you again for listening to me, an if I can help you in any way please feel free to let me know.  Your friend always Darrell Walker.

We have a new billing software for wireless phones that would save the State of Florida, other government agencies a substantial amount of money.  I would like to meet with you or someone in your administration to demonstrate our new product.  Please have someone contact me regarding this issue.
 
In closing, please let me know the next time you are in Broward/Palm Beach County because I still would like for you meet my fianc regarding the Florida education system.  Donna is very frustrated this year and if things do not change soon, most likely the State of Florida will be losing one of its finest teachers in the very near future. 
 
Once again, thank you so much for always responding to my emails.
 
Have a great day.

Confirmed authors for the Naples event:

*	Al Roker (Morning Show Fame and author of Don't Make Me Stop This Car: Adventures in Fatherhood)  Will also do the community event in the morning with children. 

*	Michael Beschloss (historian; just came out with new book on Lyndon Johnson) 

*	Al Smith ( Ophra's chef and author of Back to the Table: the Reunion of Food and Family)...Governor - Al is thrilled!  Says, "Thank you!" and will be cooking the lunch for everyone as well as reading.

Question:  We have an opportunity to perhaps also include Dr. Suess's wife - I thought it might appeal to the Naples' crowd; however, I know that Mr. Beschloss uses oral tape and therefore may go a bit long.  Do you both have opinions on whether we should keep it at these three authors or expand to include Dr. Suess's wife?
 
Also, Dr. Robin Cook will join us but will just say a few words at the dinner (only).  Governor, I also talked with Al and I believe we all have an understanding of our roles and should not trip over each others toes.
 
If you open the DRAFT attached advertisement which will run in Gulf Life Shores and the business magazine of southwest Florida, pay NO attention to spelling, grammar, or writing, it is very draft, but does give a nice idea of the ad setup.

An Orlando station interviewed an Orange County High School principal
(didn't catch the school) on budget cuts, I guess yesterday--I just
caught
it on the 5:30 am news.  His comments brought to light the entire issue
of
accountability.  He stated that his school will be looking at the
unpopular
weak programs to cut and keep the more popular stronger programs.  The
verbiage--popular used synonymously with weak, is of concern.  It is
about
accountability and what constitutes a strong or a weak program.  To me,
at
least, it is disturbing that schools gauge program success on
popularity--which is about what feels good or may be just an easy A with
a
teacher who lets kids sleep in class and does not correlate the skills
they
attain with their grade.  More often than not--that would fit this
principals definition, as well as many others, of a strong program while
another academically rigorous course may be unpopular and classified as
weak. Of course students will shun away from ineffective teachers--but
that
is the exception rather than the rule--most of them in my experience
give
easy grades to keep everyone happy and 25 years later still teach the
same
class.

This underscores the need for accountability and for some concrete
definitions to be put into place on what constitutes a weak program and
a
strong program - especially when we are cutting "weak" programs due to
budget issues. Perhaps a note for schools and districts to be careful
how
they determine what they will cut and what they will not?  Florida
students
could have viable courses cut and consequently are the losers here if
such a
liberal rule is applied to measure program success based on student
popularity of a course.  Using that scale we will wind up keeping the
ceramics class and cut introduction to word processing, electronics or
chemistry III.    This also highlights the need for re-engineering
guidance
department methodologies and technologies on how courses are selected in
the
first place and the level of parental involvement--but that's an
entirely
other issue--although related.


Thanks for letting me share these concerns with you, and thank you for
listening.  There are no easy answers.

FDA Urges Pill to Combat Radiation

By Justin Gillis


Spurred by fears of nuclear terrorism, the Food and Drug Administration yesterday called for widespread use of a cheap, readily available pill soon after an attack to protect people against thyroid cancer.

The FDA issued new guidelines for the use of a drug called potassium iodide. They break relatively little medical ground. But by emphasizing the proven usefulness of the drug in countering radioactive fallout, the FDA's action is likely to feed a growing discussion in the country about how broadly the drug should be stockpiled.

Authorities have known for decades that taking potassium iodide before or right after exposure to radioactive fallout can prevent some ill effects, especially in young children, who are most vulnerable to thyroid cancer. 

The revised FDA guidelines use studies done after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear plant disaster to recommend new dosage levels for various groups, replacing guidelines based on studies of the atomic bombings in Japan in 1945.

Only a handful of states maintain stockpiles of the drug. The Department of Health and Human Services is studying whether to add potassium iodide to a national stockpile it maintains of drugs and supplies to counter large-scale terror strikes.

Some groups, noting that the drug costs as little as 10 cents a dose in bulk, have called for even broader stockpiling -- for instance, in all schools and homes that could be affected by the bombing of a nuclear plant.

"All the studies I've seen have shown that it does provide protection, particularly for young children," said David Lochbaum, a nuclear expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a watchdog group. "Considering its price, it just seems like a no-brainer. We should have been doing this a long time ago."

He cautioned, however, that potassium iodide protects against only one type of radiation exposure and is no substitute for preventing attacks or for evacuating people after an attack. 

Some state officials are skeptical of stockpiling the drug for the same reason, saying their main focus would be on moving people out of the path of a fallout plume and preventing contamination of the food supply. Alabama, Arizona, Maine and Tennessee are the only states with large stockpiles of potassium iodide.

A handful of states maintain smaller stockpiles, and many others have begun discussing the issue since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, realizing that nuclear plants could be prime targets. The FDA emphasized yesterday that potassium iodide should be taken within hours of a radiation release and this "requires a ready supply" of the drug.

The biology works this way: The one organ in the body that uses a lot of iodine is the thyroid gland, which produces substances that help regulate metabolism. Iodine is such an important nutrient that a form of it is routinely added to salt to help prevent deficiencies.

Iodine is not normally radioactive. However, one of the prime consequences of nuclear attack or accident would be the release of radioactive forms of the element into the air and possibly the food supply. The radioactive iodine could concentrate in the thyroid glands of exposed people, particularly fast-growing children, elevating their risk of thyroid cancer.

The absorption of radioactive iodine can be slowed, however, if exposed people quickly take a large dose of nonradioactive iodine -- "flooding" the thyroid gland with the safe form of the element. Potassium iodide pills are the preferred way to do this. The pills would ideally be taken by anyone who could be exposed to fallout within a few hours of a nuclear-plant bombing or other release of radioactivity.

The FDA emphasized yesterday that the benefits of potassium iodide in the midst of a radiation disaster are clear, and the risks minimal even if people overdose on the drug. Potassium iodide is not a prescription drug, and anybody who wants to can buy it, though most pharmacies don't stock the drug.

This is my response letter sent to Wendy Berger after her last contact, just for your informational purposes.

  

To Whom It May Concern:

 

          I fully understand that things do not just happen overnight.  I am a teacher with a masters degree and I have done my homework on our justice system and rehabilitation centers.  I do know however that my family and I are not asking you to let my nephew just walk out the door.  We are asking for an extensive, residential drug rehabilitation program.  While you are going through all of the research that it takes for commutation of sentence, he could be getting rehabilitation.  I have spent countless hours researching rehabilitation programs and as I have stated in previous letters, Dunklin Memorial is the rehabilitation center of choice.  It seems to have the best success rate of any that I have found and he could be there as part of the sentence.  

          I have taught many students through the years about justice, the Preamble, the Constitution, Congress, the pledge to our flag, etc.  I believed in all that it stood for but the older I get the more I realize that the justice that everyone speaks of is not necessarily equal.   It seems that in our country, if you have a well-known name or have enough money for an excellent attorney, things go easier on you to begin with and you get the opportunity of rehabilitation after numerous slaps on the hand.  For those people the expression has been stated many times, They dont need prison, they have an illness and an illness needs to be treated as such.  My nephew definitely has that same illness and everything he was charged with was done under the influence of drugs and yet he has not been given that privilege as part of the justice.

          I apologize in advance for what seems like a rotten attitude, but I am truly tired of watching the news and reading the paper and hearing that one more prominent person or celebrity has been given rehabilitation and yet my nephew sits in prison for the same type of crime wasting away and nothing to say for making a more productive citizen when he does get out.  Just because we dont have a prominent name and we arent celebrities doesnt mean that our lives and those that are dear to us arent worthy of the same justice.

 

                                                          Sad and disillusioned,

Jeb

An Orlando station interviewed an Orange County High School principal
(didn't catch the school) on budget cuts, I guess yesterday--I just caught
it on the 5:30 am news.  His comments brought to light the entire issue of
accountability.  He stated that his school will be looking at the unpopular
weak programs to cut and keep the more popular stronger programs.  The
verbiage--popular used synonymously with weak, is of concern.  It is about
accountability and what constitutes a strong or a weak program.  To me, at
least, it is disturbing that schools gauge program success on
popularity--which is about what feels good or may be just an easy A with a
teacher who lets kids sleep in class and does not correlate the skills they
attain with their grade.  More often than not--that would fit this
principals definition, as well as many others, of a strong program while
another academically rigorous course may be unpopular and classified as
weak. Of course students will shun away from ineffective teachers--but that
is the exception rather than the rule--most of them in my experience give
easy grades to keep everyone happy and 25 years later still teach the same
class.

This underscores the need for accountability and for some concrete
definitions to be put into place on what constitutes a weak program and a
strong program - especially when we are cutting "weak" programs due to
budget issues. Perhaps a note for schools and districts to be careful how
they determine what they will cut and what they will not?  Florida students
could have viable courses cut and consequently are the losers here if such a
liberal rule is applied to measure program success based on student
popularity of a course.  Using that scale we will wind up keeping the
ceramics class and cut introduction to word processing, electronics or
chemistry III.    This also highlights the need for re-engineering guidance
department methodologies and technologies on how courses are selected in the
first place and the level of parental involvement--but that's an entirely
other issue--although related.


Thanks for letting me share these concerns with you, and thank you for
listening.  There are no easy answers.

FDA Urges Pill to Combat Radiation

By Justin Gillis


Spurred by fears of nuclear terrorism, the Food and Drug Administration yesterday called for widespread use of a cheap, readily available pill soon after an attack to protect people against thyroid cancer.

The FDA issued new guidelines for the use of a drug called potassium iodide. They break relatively little medical ground. But by emphasizing the proven usefulness of the drug in countering radioactive fallout, the FDA's action is likely to feed a growing discussion in the country about how broadly the drug should be stockpiled.

Authorities have known for decades that taking potassium iodide before or right after exposure to radioactive fallout can prevent some ill effects, especially in young children, who are most vulnerable to thyroid cancer. 

The revised FDA guidelines use studies done after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear plant disaster to recommend new dosage levels for various groups, replacing guidelines based on studies of the atomic bombings in Japan in 1945.

Only a handful of states maintain stockpiles of the drug. The Department of Health and Human Services is studying whether to add potassium iodide to a national stockpile it maintains of drugs and supplies to counter large-scale terror strikes.

Some groups, noting that the drug costs as little as 10 cents a dose in bulk, have called for even broader stockpiling -- for instance, in all schools and homes that could be affected by the bombing of a nuclear plant.

"All the studies I've seen have shown that it does provide protection, particularly for young children," said David Lochbaum, a nuclear expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a watchdog group. "Considering its price, it just seems like a no-brainer. We should have been doing this a long time ago."

He cautioned, however, that potassium iodide protects against only one type of radiation exposure and is no substitute for preventing attacks or for evacuating people after an attack. 

Some state officials are skeptical of stockpiling the drug for the same reason, saying their main focus would be on moving people out of the path of a fallout plume and preventing contamination of the food supply. Alabama, Arizona, Maine and Tennessee are the only states with large stockpiles of potassium iodide.

A handful of states maintain smaller stockpiles, and many others have begun discussing the issue since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, realizing that nuclear plants could be prime targets. The FDA emphasized yesterday that potassium iodide should be taken within hours of a radiation release and this "requires a ready supply" of the drug.

The biology works this way: The one organ in the body that uses a lot of iodine is the thyroid gland, which produces substances that help regulate metabolism. Iodine is such an important nutrient that a form of it is routinely added to salt to help prevent deficiencies.

Iodine is not normally radioactive. However, one of the prime consequences of nuclear attack or accident would be the release of radioactive forms of the element into the air and possibly the food supply. The radioactive iodine could concentrate in the thyroid glands of exposed people, particularly fast-growing children, elevating their risk of thyroid cancer.

The absorption of radioactive iodine can be slowed, however, if exposed people quickly take a large dose of nonradioactive iodine -- "flooding" the thyroid gland with the safe form of the element. Potassium iodide pills are the preferred way to do this. The pills would ideally be taken by anyone who could be exposed to fallout within a few hours of a nuclear-plant bombing or other release of radioactivity.

The FDA emphasized yesterday that the benefits of potassium iodide in the midst of a radiation disaster are clear, and the risks minimal even if people overdose on the drug. Potassium iodide is not a prescription drug, and anybody who wants to can buy it, though most pharmacies don't stock the drug.

The new guidelines call for daily doses of potassium iodide at the following levels for those likely to be exposed to radioactive fallout:

 Infants less than 1 month old: 16 milligrams.

 Children aged 1 month to 3 years: 32 milligrams.

 Children 3 to 18 years old: 65 milligrams.

 Adults, including pregnant and lactating women, and adolescents over 150 pounds: 130 milligrams.

Good Morning Gov. Bush,
 
 Sir I have heard that you are suppose to make a decision today on whether or not to cut the 3 pilot projects because of the budget crunch.  Sir I implore you to please consider letting these projects finish running their course through June as originally planned.  Stopping them now would from all indications cost the state more in State Funding than it would if they where left in place.  I Say this from experience with the programs.  The people on these programs are saving the State of Florida thousands if not millions in state revenue.  They are making purchases at a much lower cost than the state can at this time for their consumable medical products and durable goods.  They are getting much more for the money that the state provides them than the state can.  They are paying lower rate for repite, companion and personal care because they can hire non-certified family members or friends for these services than having to riley on companies the state hires at a much higher rate.  
  Please consider very carefully because there are some clients on the pilot project that will not be eligible to go back on the Med - Waiver program and will be left eith no support at all except to be place into a state institution which will cost the state three times as much in support.  Thank you again for listening to me, an if I can help you in any way please feel free to let me know.  Your friend always Darrell Walker.

Subject: Matter of Choice Pilot Project


Good Morning Gov. Bush,
 
 Sir I have heard that you are suppose to make a decision today on whether or not to cut the 3 pilot projects because of the budget crunch.  Sir I implore you to please consider letting these projects finish running their course through June as originally planned.  Stopping them now would from all indications cost the state more in State Funding than it would if they where left in place.  I Say this from experience with the programs.  The people on these programs are saving the State of Florida thousands if not millions in state revenue.  They are making purchases at a much lower cost than the state can at this time for their consumable medical products and durable goods.  They are getting much more for the money that the state provides them than the state can.  They are paying lower rate for repite, companion and personal care because they can hire non-certified family members or friends for these services than having to riley on companies the state hires at a much higher rate.  
  Please consider very carefully because there are some clients on the pilot project that will not be eligible to go back on the Med - Waiver program and will be left eith no support at all except to be place into a state institution which will cost the state three times as much in support.  Thank you again for listening to me, an if I can help you in any way please feel free to let me know.  Your friend always Darrell Walker.

Governor,

As you know I am involved with a variety of disability activities.  One of
them happens to be the National Association on Alcohol, Drugs, and
Disabilities (NAADD).

We are trying to secure a federal grant and set up shop in Florida,
specifically in Orlando at the University of Central Florida.

The intent of the grant is to establish the relationships, produce the
dialogue, and begin providing services to those with disabilities needing
intervention.  Attached, you will find both a proposal letter and a Draft
Support Letter.

If your office could send one out under your signature, this would certainly
improve our chances of being awarded this ground breaking grant.  Of course,
we have contacted Jim and Ken.

I appreciate your leadership and thank you in advance for your help.

Subject: Communities In Schools Funding


Dear Governor Bush ,
 
I am a very proud member of the Board of Directors of Communities In Schools (CIS) of Florida and Communities In Schools of Hillsborough. I am writing to plead with you to exercise your Governors veto of budget line item 4.  Communities In School is an exceptionally well managed non-profit that is succeeding at achieving its very worthy mission of keeping at risk kids in school. Funding from the State of Florida has already been cut by two-thirds for this year.  Please do not allow it to be cut in half again by the special session.  Please veto line item 4.
 
In this time of budget limitations, we realize that there are many vying for taxpayer dollars. Please keep in mind that CIS matches each state dollar with eight dollars raised from individuals, corporations or grants. This powerful combination allows CIS to go into schools and give hope to struggling students and their parents and relief to classroom teachers already stretched to the limit. Our programs include reading tutoring for our youngest students so they have the basic skills for life long learning, self-esteem building through a caring adult mentor and high tech computer networking skills for future studies and employment.  
 
This organization has a strong infrastructure. It was started over 20 years ago and has been in the State of Florida for more than 10 years. This organization has gained the support and trust of the community and its constituents. This additional cut will eliminate the infrastructure necessary to continue to leverage additional dollars, to continue to collaborate with Take Stock In Children and Florida READS and possibly to continue to operate our programs.
 
I have donated many hours of my time for the past ten years because I have seen first hand the successes of these Communities In Schools programs.  As a former Burger King franchisee we received a Governors Community Investment Award in 2000 for our program at Monroe Middle School.  We are making a positive impact on the lives of our young citizens that live under the most difficult circumstances. 
 
Every dollar spent on our youth today saves money on expensive intervention in the future.  Another cut to the CIS budget puts the future of the organization at risk.  These students need our support.  Please veto line item 4.  
 
Thank you for your time and support.
 
 
 
Sincerely,
Lauren B. McLamore

ANOTHER WRONG-HEADED TRY FOR STILTSVILLE

Once again, U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R.-Miami, is trying to preserve
Stiltsville for the pleasure of a few at the expense of the many. Now Ms.
Ros-Lehtinen is pushing to keep the Biscayne National Park shacks in private
ownership to Florida's governor and Cabinet. This argument failed where it
really counted, in Washington, D.C. It deserves the same fate in
Tallahassee.
Stiltsville is now part of the national park, but the state gave 25-year
leases on individual structures perched in the shallows -- with the
understanding that when the leases expired they would revert to the park.
This arrangement often is used when national parks expand. But the
Stiltsville folks weren't satisfied with 25 years. The leases have been
extended annually three times since 1999.

Ms. Ros-Lehtinen is promoting a swap wherein 74 acres of mostly lifeless bay
bottom owned by the state would be exchanged for the lush bottomland under
Stiltsville. The Cabinet would have to OK this swap, but it would still need
federal approval, too.

It's time that Stiltsville become part of the public domain. To abrogate the
original intent just to suit property owners who agreed to the original
lease terms would set a terrible precedent that could do harm in other
national parks. Ms. Ros-Lehtinen's constituents surely have more pressing
needs that she could be fighting to obtain than this Quixotic pursuit.

Good afternoon, Governor. I correspond today with my hat on as Chairman of
Communities in Schools of Florida, Inc. I think you know the value this
stay in school program brings to Florida's education system, through its
own programs and by providing a platform for the delivery of other
programs, like the mentoring program of Take Stock in Children.

We began the year with a $3 million investment from the state. During the
regular session of the legislature our appropriation was reduced by $2
million. In the latest special session our appropriation was reduced
another fifty per cent to $500,000. While we understand and accept the need
to tighten our belts in the economic times we face, I respectfully submit
that we seem to be bearing a disproportionate cut in funding when compared
to most child services organizations, where cuts in appropriations have
taken away only the increase they received during the regular legislative
session. I can assure you our board is doing everything possible to secure
additional monies in the private sector. These efforts, unfortunately, will
not offset the significant loss in state funding we are facing this year.
Some of our local programs were already at risk with the initial funding
loss. We now find ourselves in a survival mode and are taking all
appropriate actions to properly manage our assets in an effort to maintain
this important program.

I respectfully request your favorable consideration in vetoing budget line
itme 4 of the budget  presented to you at the conclusion of last week's
second special legislative session. Although we would still face a 2/3 cut
in appropriations from 2000 we could keep our doors open.

Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,

Mike Jennings

A.  Does the fact that a discharge enters a creek affect its designation?
B.  Some people want the state to designate the Holmes Creek as an
outstanding Florida waterbody --- what would keep it from happening?
C.  What would be the process for redesignating a surface water body?
D.  What are the discharges into Holmes Creek and their status?
	Graceville WWTP?
	Chipley WWTP?
	Vernon WWTP? 
	Others?
1. A discharge into a water body does NOT change its designation.  The
"Class" is what is looked at and the "Designation" as OFW means that the
discharge is given closer review.  Also, new discharges must meet
antidegradation review and address NPDES criteria as a new surface water
discharge.  Normally, if a waterbody changes designation, an area around the
discharge point is preserved as not being OFW to allow the discharge to
remain.

2.  They would have to petition the State for the designation as it will
place restrictions on the County, Cities and State as a whole on use of the
waters.  With TMDLs, there could be an impact on agricultural use of the
land
due to current runoff practices.

3.  Contact Janet Klemm, DEP Tallahassee, at SunCom 291-9928 as she is
already working some redesignations and looking to she how they impact
current utilities.  If the boundaries are made with not grandfathering, some
cities would be severly economically impacted in upgrade expenditures to
their facilities.

4.  I maintain that we need another WW and PW map of our district and have
not been able to get one since Eric Ericson left.  Greg can give you
violation status of each place.  Chipley discharges into a creek that runs
into a stream that runs into Holmes Creek.  The creek would not necessarily
be "OFW" and travel time of effluent would come into play.

Governor:

David asked me to advise you that we have worked with DCA to respond to
the
Daytona Beach News Journal story below.  We have provided DCA with the
positive news of the state's extraordinary efforts toward beach
renourishment.  DCA took the lead in responding to the question of
funding
based upon their role as coordinator with FEMA on these matters.  It was
determined that there was insufficient "eligible" damages to justify a
disaster request to FEMA.  Bottom line: we are responding while
remaining on
offense.  Best regards.

Gov. Bush denies Brevard and Indian River counties money to renourish
beaches

By Linda Jump
FLORIDA TODAY

WABASSO -- Cheryl Gerstner has watched the beach in front of her
Surfside
Terrace home erode 20 feet, threatening to send her home into the
Atlantic
Ocean if more sand is lost. She's hoping Tropical Storm Olga won't take
any
more.

Brevard and Indian River counties officials are watching carefully too,
after learning that any immediate repairs to erosion will be paid either
by
them or private homeowners.

Gov. Jeb Bush determined this week that the $8 to $10 million worth of
damage reported by several East Coast counties after Hurricane Michelle
early this month didn't rise to the level needed to qualify for state or
federal emergency aid.

Indian River County had asked for $1 million in erosion control measures
to
help rebuild its beaches from the hurricane, which never hit land but
whipped up the surf, said Jonathan Gorham, county environmental
engineer.
Brevard asked for even less since previous work to save its shoreline
prevented major damage.

But Gorham said without a disaster declaration, both counties are left
without a lot of options. "It's the individual homeowner's
responsibility to
protect their property," Gorham said.

The state Office of Beaches and Shores on Thursday approved permits for
four
Dubloon Drive families north of the Wabasso Causeway to build sea walls,
and
issued a temporary permit for Surfside Terrace for sandbags and sand
until
more permanent measures can be taken.

Gerstner said that won't solve the problem. She has personally
purchased,
filled, tied and piled more than 1,000 sandbags "only to have them roll
on
the beach like they were styrofoam."

"We just want to solve our own problems with our own money to protect
our
property," Gerstner said.

Gorham said many think only hurricanes cause beach erosion, but often,
the
fall and winter northeasters cause as much, if not more, damage. "So
far, we
really haven't seen any affects from Tropical Storm Olga because the
waves
are nowhere as large as predicted," he said.

Nathan B. McCollum, emergency management coordinator, said Olga isn't
expected to hit land in Indian River County. Nor will it hit Brevard .
But
the swelled waves and eastern winds from the storm still could gouge
dunes,
he said.

Hurricane Michelle, on the other hand, took five to six feet of dune
daily
in some areas of the Indian River County after Nov. 6, Gorham said.

Elizabeth,

    Thanks so much for sending the release. I'm writing a story about 
electronic prescription tracking systems like the one that Governor Bush

hopes to create in Florida. There is a growing effort to create these 
systems because of the problems associated with OxyContin.

I was hoping to talk to the Governor for five minutes. I have the
following 
questions:

* Why does Florida need a electronic system that tracks prescriptions? 
Could it have helped identify the abuse of OxyContin before it reached 
almost epidemic levels in Florida and other states? Could this help 
officials identify the next prescription drug that addicts turn to?
Could 
this help stop people from dying unnecessarily from abuse of OxyContin
and 
other prescription drugs?

* In many states, doctors, drug companies and pharmacies have lobbied 
against attempts to create these programs. The most often used argument 
against these systems is that they violate the privacy of patients.
Would 
Florida's system have benefits that would outweigh any loss of privacy?

* Last week, at a press conference, the Governor mentioned that he had
once 
taken OxyContin after he crushed a finger. What did he learn from that 
experience?

Thanks so very much.

My direct line is 212-556-5121. I'll be here until about 7 p.m. tonight
and 
back at 10 a.m. tomorrow.

Dear Governor: 

Again, thank you for the opportunity allowing me to serve our citizens in the great state of Florida.  I felt inspired to send this note to you.   

It is my belief that by divine design Florida has been at the helm in developing a response to the potential use of biological agents as a model for other sates to follow; largely in part, due to our experience in the handling of natural disasters or in this case, chemical/biological/man-made disasters.  It shows our willingness to be proactive and at the forefront of ensuring the well being of our community, state and nation.  Of course, having somewhat of a blueprint from the past weeks of the Anthrax scenario, affecting and originating in our state, has been helpful towards perfecting such a plan of action.  Timely and adequate responses of leadership certainly lessens tensions and fears of the people who look to their leaders for the comfort of security they have always been accustomed to. 

I've always remembered your campaign promise of past, "We Can Do Better."  We have and shall continue that mantra. I have confidence that our citizens will be the primary beneficiaries of this exercise for enhancing their safety and protection.

  
With that said, this exercise has been and immense benefit to me and hopefully, to everyone else who was in attendance today.  I believe wholeheartedly that vigilance and preparedness is an insurance policy for our security.  


Sincerely, 

Mary Hooks

Subject:	Communities In Schools Funding

Dear Governor Bush ,
 
I am a very proud member of the Board of Directors of Communities In Schools (CIS) of Florida and Communities In Schools of Hillsborough. I am writing to plead with you to exercise your Governors veto of budget line item 4.  Communities In School is an exceptionally well managed non-profit that is succeeding at achieving its very worthy mission of keeping at risk kids in school. Funding from the State of Florida has already been cut by two-thirds for this year.  Please do not allow it to be cut in half again by the special session.  Please veto line item 4.
 
In this time of budget limitations, we realize that there are many vying for taxpayer dollars. Please keep in mind that CIS matches each state dollar with eight dollars raised from individuals, corporations or grants. This powerful combination allows CIS to go into schools and give hope to struggling students and their parents and relief to classroom teachers already stretched to the limit. Our programs include reading tutoring for our youngest students so they have the basic skills for life long learning, self-esteem building through a caring adult mentor and high tech computer networking skills for future studies and employment.  
 
This organization has a strong infrastructure. It was started over 20 years ago and has been in the State of Florida for more than 10 years. This organization has gained the support and trust of the community and its constituents. This additional cut will eliminate the infrastructure necessary to continue to leverage additional dollars, to continue to collaborate with Take Stock In Children and Florida READS and possibly to continue to operate our programs.
 
I have donated many hours of my time for the past ten years because I have seen first hand the successes of these Communities In Schools programs.  As a former Burger King franchisee we received a Governors Community Investment Award in 2000 for our program at Monroe Middle School.  We are making a positive impact on the lives of our young citizens that live under the most difficult circumstances. 
 
Every dollar spent on our youth today saves money on expensive intervention in the future.  Another cut to the CIS budget puts the future of the organization at risk.  These students need our support.  Please veto line item 4.  
 
Thank you for your time and support.
 
 
 
Sincerely,
Lauren B. McLamore

Governor,

As you know I am involved with a variety of disability activities.  One of
them happens to be the National Association on Alcohol, Drugs, and
Disabilities (NAADD).

We are trying to secure a federal grant and set up shop in Florida,
specifically in Orlando at the University of Central Florida.

The intent of the grant is to establish the relationships, produce the
dialogue, and begin providing services to those with disabilities needing
intervention.  Attached, you will find both a proposal letter and a Draft
Support Letter.

If your office could send one out under your signature, this would certainly
improve our chances of being awarded this ground breaking grant.  Of course,
we have contacted Jim and Ken.

I appreciate your leadership and thank you in advance for your help.

     Subject: traffic light



     Jeb,


     Would you help me in expediting the process of approving a traffic
     light? The
     area of concern is the N. Monroe / Universal Rd. (between Tallahassee
     mall
     and Hooters) This unique portion of N. Monroe is home for 12
     restaurants.
     Turning left to access any of these establishments has resulted in
     many
     wrecks and close calls. A few of which I've personally witnessed while

     dining. Entering and leaving these restaurants during peek periods
     also
     results in delays and drive-thru backups. For example; the delay in
     leaving
     the Chic-Fil-A in the morning is 7 minutes waiting for the light at
     John knox
     to turn.


     I'm no traffic engineer but I believe the time duration of the light
     would be
     quick since Universal doesn't cross N. Monroe. So rather than a 4 way
     it
     would only be a 3 way light signal. Its location is precisely halfway
     between
     Northwood shopping center and John Knox Road. With 12 restaurants now
     on that
     stretch, a left hand turn during breakfast, lunch or dinner has become
     a life
     threatening task. Even if this light could be activated during those
     times
     and remain a flashing yellow the rest of the day would be an
     improvement.


     Eating establishments are: EL Chico, Arby's, Chic-fil-A, Roadhouse,
     Boston
     market, DQ, Miami subs, 4TH Quarter, Woody's BBQ, Rallys, Silver
     Slipper,
     Lindy's.


     Thanks for anything you can do, let me know what I can do as well.

Dear Governor Bush, 

As you are aware, I would like to create an A+ School Recognition day in the state of Florida. I have secured the sponsorship of 578 A+ flags to be presented to all the A schools in the state of Florida on your behalf and behalf of the Florida legislature. We have been in contact with the Lt. Governor Brogan's office concerning the planning of a press conference detailing the kickoff of this event statewide. We came to a consensus that best time to hold this press conference and have you present is in January before the opening of the legislative session. My thought is to hold this press conference at Ernest R. Graham Elementary School a Miami Dade County Public School in my legislative district. 

I look forward to having this event become a reality. Thank you in advance for your continued support, I hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely, 


Ralph

Governor:

David asked me to advise you that we have worked with DCA to respond to
the
Daytona Beach News Journal story below.  We have provided DCA with the
positive news of the state's extraordinary efforts toward beach
renourishment.  DCA took the lead in responding to the question of
funding
based upon their role as coordinator with FEMA on these matters.  It was
determined that there was insufficient "eligible" damages to justify a
disaster request to FEMA.  Bottom line: we are responding while
remaining on
offense.  Best regards.

Gov. Bush denies Brevard and Indian River counties money to renourish
beaches

By Linda Jump
FLORIDA TODAY

WABASSO -- Cheryl Gerstner has watched the beach in front of her
Surfside
Terrace home erode 20 feet, threatening to send her home into the
Atlantic
Ocean if more sand is lost. She's hoping Tropical Storm Olga won't take
any
more.

Brevard and Indian River counties officials are watching carefully too,
after learning that any immediate repairs to erosion will be paid either
by
them or private homeowners.

Gov. Jeb Bush determined this week that the $8 to $10 million worth of
damage reported by several East Coast counties after Hurricane Michelle
early this month didn't rise to the level needed to qualify for state or
federal emergency aid.

Indian River County had asked for $1 million in erosion control measures
to
help rebuild its beaches from the hurricane, which never hit land but
whipped up the surf, said Jonathan Gorham, county environmental
engineer.
Brevard asked for even less since previous work to save its shoreline
prevented major damage.

But Gorham said without a disaster declaration, both counties are left
without a lot of options. "It's the individual homeowner's
responsibility to
protect their property," Gorham said.

The state Office of Beaches and Shores on Thursday approved permits for
four
Dubloon Drive families north of the Wabasso Causeway to build sea walls,
and
issued a temporary permit for Surfside Terrace for sandbags and sand
until
more permanent measures can be taken.

Gerstner said that won't solve the problem. She has personally
purchased,
filled, tied and piled more than 1,000 sandbags "only to have them roll
on
the beach like they were styrofoam."

"We just want to solve our own problems with our own money to protect
our
property," Gerstner said.

Gorham said many think only hurricanes cause beach erosion, but often,
the
fall and winter northeasters cause as much, if not more, damage. "So
far, we
really haven't seen any affects from Tropical Storm Olga because the
waves
are nowhere as large as predicted," he said.

Nathan B. McCollum, emergency management coordinator, said Olga isn't
expected to hit land in Indian River County. Nor will it hit Brevard .
But
the swelled waves and eastern winds from the storm still could gouge
dunes,
he said.

Hurricane Michelle, on the other hand, took five to six feet of dune
daily
in some areas of the Indian River County after Nov. 6, Gorham said.

     Subject: traffic light



     Jeb,


     Would you help me in expediting the process of approving a traffic
     light? The
     area of concern is the N. Monroe / Universal Rd. (between Tallahassee
     mall
     and Hooters) This unique portion of N. Monroe is home for 12
     restaurants.
     Turning left to access any of these establishments has resulted in
     many
     wrecks and close calls. A few of which I've personally witnessed while

     dining. Entering and leaving these restaurants during peek periods
     also
     results in delays and drive-thru backups. For example; the delay in
     leaving
     the Chic-Fil-A in the morning is 7 minutes waiting for the light at
     John knox
     to turn.


     I'm no traffic engineer but I believe the time duration of the light
     would be
     quick since Universal doesn't cross N. Monroe. So rather than a 4 way
     it
     would only be a 3 way light signal. Its location is precisely halfway
     between
     Northwood shopping center and John Knox Road. With 12 restaurants now
     on that
     stretch, a left hand turn during breakfast, lunch or dinner has become
     a life
     threatening task. Even if this light could be activated during those
     times
     and remain a flashing yellow the rest of the day would be an
     improvement.


     Eating establishments are: EL Chico, Arby's, Chic-fil-A, Roadhouse,
     Boston
     market, DQ, Miami subs, 4TH Quarter, Woody's BBQ, Rallys, Silver
     Slipper,
     Lindy's.


     Thanks for anything you can do, let me know what I can do as well.

Subject:	Urgent - Communities in Schools

Governor,
Communities in Schools is in a crisis situation now. I have supported this organization for 17 years, and this is the first time our State program is in great peril. Our budget was cut from 3 million dollars last year to 1 million dollars this year. Although cuts were necessary a 2/3 cut caused us to reconfigure all our services. It appears that the new budget is going to cut an additional 500 thousand dollars.
These cuts are disproportionate to other organizations' cuts whose monies were primarily cut from increases in this years funding.Operating on a 500 thousand dollar budget from 3 millon dollars will also jeopardize a 2 million dollar grant we received from federal dollars (a loss of an additional 2 million dollars to our state's education system.
I truly hope you will Veto our line item (4) and enable us to continue to address the needs of the at risk students in our state. It costs us less to support them now, then in our Juvenile Justice System.
Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to seeing you Saturday evening at your Christmas party.

Subject:	Budget cuts

Dear Gov. Bush, 

Thank you for having Paul Strickland respond to my
email. I appreciate your interest in what voters like
myself think. 

I also appreciate that corporations benefit from tax
exemptions and this can in turn help stimulate the
economy. I do not agree though that tax exemptions for
organizations such as golf courses are necessary for
economic stimulus.

As for the developmentally disabled community, I do
not see how it can be stated that their needs are
being met when over 6700 individuals from the July
1999 wait list were suppose to begin to receive
services in March of 2002 are now not going to receive
services this fiscal year. Currently there is no plan
to provide services for these individuals because
there are insufficient funds in the budget to provide
for all of those with Developmental Disabilities.
Also, this figure does not include some 4000
additional individuals who have applied for services
since July 1999. 

I fail to understand the logic of placing individuals
with disabilities in nursing homes. For example, a 35
year old with Cerebral Palsy who has some medical
involvement; if I understand your response correctly;
would have to live in a nursing home if this was the
most cost effective arrangement. What about this
individuals friends, family, and interests? What about
thier quality of life? 

Individuals with disabilities should have the same
opportunities for living situations as everyone else
whether it is in the family home, an apartment or home
of their own, or other community living arrangement.
They should not be forced into group homes, nursing
homes, or institutions. 

I was glad to hear that the $77,000 CAP will not be
implemented. Thank you for any assistance you offered
in keeping this from happening. Also, thank you for
keeping some of the needed funding in General Revenue.


I sincerely hope more consideration will be given to
eliminating many of the current tax exemptions on the
books. It is imperative that Florida build a recurring
tax base that does rely so heavily on tourism dollars.
This is one way to do that. 

Thank you for listening and for all that you have
already done for those with disabilities and their
families.

Sincerely,
Kathy Rafanan

Elizabeth,

    Thanks so much for sending the release. I'm writing a story about 
electronic prescription tracking systems like the one that Governor Bush 
hopes to create in Florida. There is a growing effort to create these 
systems because of the problems associated with OxyContin.

I was hoping to talk to the Governor for five minutes. I have the following 
questions:

* Why does Florida need a electronic system that tracks prescriptions? 
Could it have helped identify the abuse of OxyContin before it reached 
almost epidemic levels in Florida and other states? Could this help 
officials identify the next prescription drug that addicts turn to? Could 
this help stop people from dying unnecessarily from abuse of OxyContin and 
other prescription drugs?

* In many states, doctors, drug companies and pharmacies have lobbied 
against attempts to create these programs. The most often used argument 
against these systems is that they violate the privacy of patients. Would 
Florida's system have benefits that would outweigh any loss of privacy?

* Last week, at a press conference, the Governor mentioned that he had once 
taken OxyContin after he crushed a finger. What did he learn from that 
experience?

Thanks so very much.

My direct line is 212-556-5121. I'll be here until about 7 p.m. tonight and

Thanks, Governor for passing this along.

I support this idea; however, a couple of issues that industry folks (from
LA mostly) have with this concept...

The drive time from the airport to Homestead is quite long which could take
it out of the local union drive radius. if crews have to drive 60 miles or
more to a job, the producer must put them up and pay an increased per diem.

Needs complete soundproofing and renovation, and a "cluster" of production
service and support co's (which can be easily done and pitched to
businesses).

I will get started on a letter of support for you to sign, as well as
provide one for the LG.

Subject:  Brevard County Shore Protection Project Funding: Phase II, South Reach

Dear Senator:

I request your leadership in obtaining federal funds for Brevard County's beaches in the 2001 Conference Energy and Water Bill.  The House bill included $8.5 million for Brevard County's Shore Protection Project, but the Senate and Administration's budgets included only $200,000.  The federal cost-share for Phase II, as authorized by Congress in 1996, is $12 million.  Brevard County needs this $12 million appropriated in the FY 2001-2002 Conference Bill.  Brevard County is relying on you to take the lead in appropriating these dollars.

A few special interest groups have attempted to label beach nourishment as pork, primarily benefiting wealthy oceanfront property owners.  This is untrue!  As the photos above indicate, the majority of those who benefit are the millions of people who relax and play on our public beaches each year.  Private property rights in America give oceanfront property owners the right to protect their investments or to be compensated by the government for lost property.  When faced with erosion, these property owners erect seawalls.  Seawalls displace public recreation, increase the pace of erosion, and destroy marine turtle nesting habitat.  Along highly developed shorelines like Brevard's, the government simply cannot afford to outlaw seawalls and fund a retreat policy.  In contrast, beach nourishment restores the beaches to a healthy width, thereby averting the demand for seawalls while simultaneously creating huge recreational and environmental benefits.  Beach nourishment saves America's beaches from seawalls.

Thank you in advance for your support.  With a $12 million appropriation in the Conference Bill, we can build back Brevard's beaches.

I realize you oppose casino gambling and while i do not agree with you I
respect your position. That being said, how do you permit places such as
Boomers in Boca Raton to have slot machines into which you deposit
Boomer tokens and either lose them or receive more tokens as a payout?
These tokens are then used to play other games or get prizes. While it
is true they are not actually cash, they serve the same function as cash
as only tokens can be used in the machines and if you don't play the
slots you must buy them at the counter.  If this is not legal gambling I
would appreciate your telling me what is.  Also,  the indians have
casinos and once there is one type of gambling all types ought to be
allowed.  The state would realize much needed income and MiamiBeach
could have a re-birth. It ought to have had legalizedgambling 75 years

'TAX ME MORE FUND' CREATES A STIR
 
Donald Lambro
THE WASHINGTON TIMES
 
-----------------------------------------------------------
 
They're chuckling, cheering and chafing in Arkansas these
days over Gov. Mike Huckabee's novel idea for raising more
taxes: He's inviting taxpayers who want to pay more to do
so. 
 
The Republican governor, who appears to be a shoo-in for a
second term next year, has set up the "Tax Me More Fund" to
give voters who think they are not taxed enough the chance
to send more money to the state.
 
Mr. Huckabee's opponents in the news media and in the state
legislature were nearly apoplectic when he announced the
creation of the fund, but the governor says he is not fazed.
"I'm having way too much fun," he says.
 
"The press is mad at me and some of the liberals in the
legislature are furious and have resorted to name-calling,
but the people understand it. They get the whole deal," the
governor said in a telephone interview.
 
"I have not had one person come up to me and say 'I haven't
been paying enough in taxes and my wife and I feel guilty we
aren't paying enough,' " he said with a chuckle.
 
Since the fund was announced, he says the Department of
Finance and Administration has collected "a whopping $260."
And that's the point that Mr. Huckabee says his
tongue-in-cheek idea makes loud and clear: Most people do
not want their taxes raised.
 
"What it does is expose the hypocrisy of the liberals
because they want to raise taxes as long as someone else has
to pay for them. Our state law does not prohibit someone
from paying more. So if they believe it would make them feel
better to contribute more, then I want them to write as
generous a check as they can to make themselves feel good,"
Mr. Huckabee said.
 
"I have a pocketful of pre-addressed envelopes for them to
mail in their checks. If someone in the legislature comes up
to me and talks about a tax increase, I pull out an envelope
and say mail it in. They just shake their head," he said.
 
Like most states during the current economic slump, Arkansas
has seen its tax revenues fall, resulting in a $142 million
deficit this year, equaling about 4 percent of the state's
budget. But Mr. Huckabee has resisted calls for a special
session of the legislature to consider new taxes.
 
"My feeling is everyone in Arkansas is having to adjust to
the downturn in the economy and every business is doing the
same. Asking Arkansas to cough up more money during a
recession is like asking a bleeding hemophiliac to donate a
pint of blood to the Red Cross," he said.
 
The governor's political opponents have attacked him with a
vengeance. Sen. John Riggs, a Little Rock Democrat, has
called Mr. Huckabee "a clown," and former Democratic Govs.
Dale Bumpers and David Pryor say that the fund is not a
serious solution to the state's budget shortfall.
 
But Mr. Huckabee, whose job approval ratings are running
over 70 percent, has been cheered on the campaign trail
whenever he raises the tax issue and pulls out his
pre-address envelopes to the Tax Me More Fund.
 
"The point that the people of Arkansas get clearly right now
is they are struggling to hold their jobs, pay their rent,
make a car payment and put a piece of baloney between two
slices of bread for lunch," he said.
 
Mr. Huckabee's political success with his tax fund has not
gone unnoticed among campaign strategists elsewhere, some of
whom think it could be used in other gubernatorial
campaigns.
 
"I think he has come up with a kind of clever ploy that has
the liberals sputtering," said Stephen Moore, president of
the Club for Growth, which supports candidates who favor tax
cuts.
 
"There is going to be increasing muttering about raising
taxes in next year's campaigns, and this type of approach by
Huckabee might be a good way to stop the liberals in their
tracks," Mr. Moore said.

Dear Governor:

Jeb, as you probably know I am on the Brunswick Corporation Board of
Directors.  Last week during our Board Meeting the possible  move of
headquarters to South Carolina came up.  I have spoken with the Chairman and
CEO - George Buckley about Florida and why this would make sense for
Brunswick.  He informed me that he has spoken with you and the interest that
the State may have in having Brunswick headquarter in Florida.

If I can be of any assistant in setting up a meeting with George or in being
of help with any introductions, do not hesitate to let me know.  

For your information our next meeting will be held in Naples, Fl. February
5th, I would be happy to host a dinner on the 4th or 5th if you think it
would help

Dear Healthy Kids Staff,
We are wondering how you monitor the families you serve? We live in Cape Coral and know a family who own two homes each valued over $100,000.00, one they rent for income and two 2002 Toyota SUV's valued around $50,00.00+ each with $5,000.00 new tires put on as it came off the showroom floor. They said their family insurance from their job went to just over $700.00 a month so they cancelled and got Healthy Kids. They have 2 children. They did say they didn't put the "truth" on the application and are approved for your program. She was clear you don't ask for resources on the application.  I am sure this is not the only family doing this, she was quite informed from the circle of families they run with in the construction business. They all seem to be getting your program. Can you look into finding a way this type of misuse doesn't continue. We are aware of many families who really can use your service and feel if this misuse continues it won't be around as it is intended for.

Gov. Bush denies Brevard and Indian River counties money to renourish
beaches

By Linda Jump
FLORIDA TODAY

WABASSO -- Cheryl Gerstner has watched the beach in front of her
Surfside
Terrace home erode 20 feet, threatening to send her home into the
Atlantic
Ocean if more sand is lost. She's hoping Tropical Storm Olga won't take
any
more.

Brevard and Indian River counties officials are watching carefully too,
after learning that any immediate repairs to erosion will be paid either
by
them or private homeowners.

Gov. Jeb Bush determined this week that the $8 to $10 million worth of
damage reported by several East Coast counties after Hurricane Michelle
early this month didn't rise to the level needed to qualify for state or
federal emergency aid.

Indian River County had asked for $1 million in erosion control measures
to
help rebuild its beaches from the hurricane, which never hit land but
whipped up the surf, said Jonathan Gorham, county environmental
engineer.
Brevard asked for even less since previous work to save its shoreline
prevented major damage.

But Gorham said without a disaster declaration, both counties are left
without a lot of options. "It's the individual homeowner's
responsibility to
protect their property," Gorham said.

The state Office of Beaches and Shores on Thursday approved permits for
four
Dubloon Drive families north of the Wabasso Causeway to build sea walls,
and
issued a temporary permit for Surfside Terrace for sandbags and sand
until
more permanent measures can be taken.

Gerstner said that won't solve the problem. She has personally
purchased,
filled, tied and piled more than 1,000 sandbags "only to have them roll
on
the beach like they were styrofoam."

"We just want to solve our own problems with our own money to protect
our
property," Gerstner said.

Gorham said many think only hurricanes cause beach erosion, but often,
the
fall and winter northeasters cause as much, if not more, damage. "So
far, we
really haven't seen any affects from Tropical Storm Olga because the
waves
are nowhere as large as predicted," he said.

Nathan B. McCollum, emergency management coordinator, said Olga isn't
expected to hit land in Indian River County. Nor will it hit Brevard .
But
the swelled waves and eastern winds from the storm still could gouge
dunes,
he said.

Hurricane Michelle, on the other hand, took five to six feet of dune
daily
in some areas of the Indian River County after Nov. 6, Gorham said.

Also, Dr. Robin Cook will join us but will just say a few words at the dinner (only).  Governor, I also talked with Al and I believe we all have an understanding of our roles and should not trip over each others toes.

Re:  Pending HCGA/ CLIA ACTION AGAINST  IGENEX

Dear Clients, Friends and Fellow Lyme Advocates and Providers

It is with deep regret and a sense of urgency that I write to you to advise
of a critical situation - the - impending shutdown of IgeneX by the
government.

To give a brief history, as many of you know, IGX has been under
investigation by HCGA/CLIA for 2  years.   We have been guilty of nothing
more than acting and speaking loudly and fearlessly on behalf of the Lyme
community.  Our tests have been state-of-the-art and we
have devoted 1/3 of our budget to research of new cutting edge tests.  We
have found positive results where others have not.  We have passed every
standard graded proficiency, and passed every inspection "with flying
colors" until July, 1999, when it appears that the CDC, HCFA/CLIA and the CA
Dept. of Field Serviced decided to make things difficult for IGX.
Coincidentally, some of the finest Lyme physicians were also targeted at the
same time.

We have provided documentation requested by these agencies, but they have
been deliberately vague in their requests, and they told us that our
documentation was never enough and never in the form that they liked,
although they never told us exactly what they did want.  We
have been found guilty until proven innocent in a no-win situation.  We have
hired lawyers and consultants at a tremendous cost to IGX, and they have
been successful in helping us until now.  The outcome was apparently
mandated and predetermined.

I will expand upon the details at the later date, but at this time I must
advise you that HCFA/CLIA HAS IMPOSED SANCTIONS ON IGX, WHICH INCLUDED THE
SHUT DOWN OF THE LAB THIS FRIDAY DECEMBER 7TH.   We learned Monday afternoon
through our attorney that the December 7th shutdown has been put on
TEMPORARY HOLD.  However, the situation is
far from resolved-it is merely a "stay."  We are doing everything in our
power to fight this, including submitting additional documents today.   We
are not shut down and we certainly hope we will not be shut down, but we can
use your help.  Some of you have already asked
how you can assist.  Here are some ideas:

ANOTHER SAMPLE LETTER


1. Fax or write letters to the people listed below.  We understand that, as
physicians, you may not wish to sign your name for fear of retaliation.  But
you may wish to write anonymously and tell them why.
2. Fax or write to your local and state representatives.  Many of them are
already aware of the situation and are attempting to intercede.
3. Encourage and advise any patients who have been helped in part by our
tests to also fax letters describing their positive experiences.
4. If you have other ideas to assist us, please do not hesitate to call me
personally at 800-832-3200

We will advise you as soon as we know the outcome.  Meanwhile, IGX will be
open to process specimens and take your phone calls.  Please remember that
IGeneX is and always has been a fine, honest and dedicated lab.

Gov. Bush denies Brevard and Indian River counties money to renourish
beaches

By Linda Jump
FLORIDA TODAY

WABASSO -- Cheryl Gerstner has watched the beach in front of her
Surfside
Terrace home erode 20 feet, threatening to send her home into the
Atlantic
Ocean if more sand is lost. She's hoping Tropical Storm Olga won't take
any
more.

Brevard and Indian River counties officials are watching carefully too,
after learning that any immediate repairs to erosion will be paid either
by
them or private homeowners.

Gov. Jeb Bush determined this week that the $8 to $10 million worth of
damage reported by several East Coast counties after Hurricane Michelle
early this month didn't rise to the level needed to qualify for state or
federal emergency aid.

Indian River County had asked for $1 million in erosion control measures
to
help rebuild its beaches from the hurricane, which never hit land but
whipped up the surf, said Jonathan Gorham, county environmental
engineer.
Brevard asked for even less since previous work to save its shoreline
prevented major damage.

But Gorham said without a disaster declaration, both counties are left
without a lot of options. "It's the individual homeowner's
responsibility to
protect their property," Gorham said.

The state Office of Beaches and Shores on Thursday approved permits for
four
Dubloon Drive families north of the Wabasso Causeway to build sea walls,
and
issued a temporary permit for Surfside Terrace for sandbags and sand
until
more permanent measures can be taken.

Gerstner said that won't solve the problem. She has personally
purchased,
filled, tied and piled more than 1,000 sandbags "only to have them roll
on
the beach like they were styrofoam."

"We just want to solve our own problems with our own money to protect
our
property," Gerstner said.

Gorham said many think only hurricanes cause beach erosion, but often,
the
fall and winter northeasters cause as much, if not more, damage. "So
far, we
really haven't seen any affects from Tropical Storm Olga because the
waves
are nowhere as large as predicted," he said.

Nathan B. McCollum, emergency management coordinator, said Olga isn't
expected to hit land in Indian River County. Nor will it hit Brevard .
But
the swelled waves and eastern winds from the storm still could gouge
dunes,
he said.

Hurricane Michelle, on the other hand, took five to six feet of dune
daily
in some areas of the Indian River County after Nov. 6, Gorham said.

Thanks to each of you who receive and read this.  We gave it all we had,
but looks like the 9-11 perpetrators have won another one.  I wrote this
letter to George Lane (my friend and mentor in legislative procedure)
this morning and thought each of you had in one way or another been involved
and I wanted you to know what is happening.

Governor Bush, you have a great young bunch of folks around you there
in Tallahassee and they did all they could to help in this trying time.
 Those folks that make up the Federal agencies just don't know or care
what is happening and I hope when you and your staff move to Washington
in 7 more years you will do what you can to unseat all those whose jobs
were protected, but who didn't feel the need to make sure others receive
adequate help.  Never did we ask for handouts; only long term loans to
help stay in business during the recovery.  They mouth good words, just
short on carry through.  Brett Doster sat with some of us from the Orlando
area and listen to people 'mouth' platitudes.  I only hope at least some
of those that attended got more attention and help than our little school.

Thanks again...........

===============================================================================
=================================

George,

I'm back from the West Coast and am happy to say things went well out
there.  Now it's time to see what I can do about the problems back here.

While I was gone the SBA has for all practical purposes turned down the
loan application (long term/low interest) for the money to replace business
lost as a result of 9-11.  They didn't exactly turn it down but said if
we wanted the paperwork to go any farther in the consideration process,
each of my sons and myself must put our homes up as collateral.  We can't
do that.  If they want personal guarantees that would be different.  You
often have to give those for a loan, but never your house.  We tried to
tell them, 'what would happen if another plane flew into the Sears Tower
in Chicago, and no airline could or would be able to hire new pilots for
several years?'  All of us would not only lose the business, but our homes
as well and that is unsatisfactory.


They say that is the chance you must take if you want the loan.  So, no
loan!  We are willing to put our personal guarantee up but not our homes.

If I had to make a guess, we will now lose the Academy, and as you know
have already lost (through selling to a new owner) Discover Air.  In order
to just meet fixed and certain variable expenses, the academy has to bring
in 20 new students each month.   Thirteen have been enrolled for the December
class and the rest (29) withdrew before they even arrived (we now have
over a million dollars in revenue withdrawls since 9-11), so that accelerates
the end of something really quite good.  There will come a time when the
pilot shortage hits that those folks in Federal programs administration
and those folks we elect to public office will regret that they have allowed
a whole industry to flounder.  They think that by throwing a 'little'
money at the major airlines who could afford expensive lobbyists, that
they have done something heroic.  I have one trump card to play and that's
getting airlines that are going to need our services to step up to the
plate and tell the next generation of pilots that there is a future for
them in the airline business.  It may really be too late for Airline Training
Academy, but maybe some others can get through this period intact.

George, if you have any plans for further involvement with the Academy,
do yourself and us a favor and terminate any time commitment.  There is
not money enough to pay our bills, such as gas, that allow us to continue
to instruct, let alone your invoice which you would have earned by the
end of December.  We have paid you for October and November but will not
be able to pay anything more.  There is not money for salaries for my
sons and so personal savings will get tapped just to make mortgage payments
from here on out.  I don't regret paying you the $5,000 in fees for services,
I just wish that we had known you at a better time when we would have
benefited more from your association.

George, even though we won't be able to have a professional association,
we are still 'brothers in Christ'.  I wish you and Libby a Holy holiday
season and the very best possible in 2002 as things get better, we hope.
 God bless you and your entire family.

Hey, Jeb. It's Truly Burton. I see you are hanging in there with budget
cuts, economic issues, and the like. We are doing the same down here. 

This coming year, BASF's 2002 Program Committee is planning to invite
some dynamic, unique speakers for the Association's General Membership
meetings. We are planning on five major meetings this year with a
variety of highlight speakers. We would very much like for you to be a
featured "highlight" speaker. Since we are planning our calendar now, I
was hoping we could get you to come speak to us, perhaps in either May
or September. We had asked your Scheduler once before (about 12-18
months ago) if you could come talk with us, but that did not work out. 

As we look toward the campaign season, would a debate format/candidates
forum be equally interesting to you? We'd work with your campaign staff
for the right location, moderator(s), questions prepared in advance,
etc.  

Please let us know either way, as the Committee wants to finalize the
2002 calendar and we want to save you the best spot - you are our Number
1 pick! Best of the holiday season to you and your family. Best, Truly.

Good Morning Gov. Bush,
 
 Sir I have heard that you are suppose to make a decision today on whether or not to cut the 3 pilot projects because of the budget crunch.  Sir I implore you to please consider letting these projects finish running their course through June as originally planned.  Stopping them now would from all indications cost the state more in State Funding than it would if they where left in place.  I Say this from experience with the programs.  The people on these programs are saving the State of Florida thousands if not millions in state revenue.  They are making purchases at a much lower cost than the state can at this time for their consumable medical products and durable goods.  They are getting much more for the money that the state provides them than the state can.  They are paying lower rate for repite, companion and personal care because they can hire non-certified family members or friends for these services than having to riley on companies the state hires at a much higher rate.  
  Please consider very carefully because there are some clients on the pilot project that will not be eligible to go back on the Med - Waiver program and will be left eith no support at all except to be place into a state institution which will cost the state three times as much in support.  Thank you again for listening to me, an if I can help you in any way please feel free to let me know.  Your friend always Darrell Walker.

CIS has already lost substantial funding that has resulted in cuts in services to students in Miami.  Our case management services to one school for 90 students was completely cut resulting in no case  managment services to students and their families.  Another cut will result in lay-off additional staff at an after school program.  CIS of Miami provides much needed services to Miami-Dade County Schools.  We target our most neediest schools such as the small alternative academies that already receive limited support and resources.  We provide literacy and math tutoring in seven schools in the heart of the poorest communities In Miami.  These services will be in jeopardy due to additional cuts.  Please help us to continue to provide tutoring, mentoring, case management, life skills programs, after school programs, and career readiness programs to over 4,000 students a year.  Please veto budget line item 4.

Governor, 
You may recall suspending Mr. Brown after he was charged with sexual battery 
and aggravated battery (both felonies) for attacking his girlfriend in 
January.  He was the man that shoved dirt down the victim's throat and 
digitally penetrated the victim's vagina.  The State Attorney's Office 
accepted a plea to a misdemeanor battery charge in July, but you agreed to 
leave the suspension order in effect based on our belief that Mr. Brown had, 
in fact, committed a felony.  (As you know, you can suspend county officers 
if they commit a felony but not if they commit a misdemeanor.)  Wendy and I 
were prepared for a trial on Monday, held before the Senate's special 
master,  to prove the felony charges and get Mr. Brown permanently removed 
from office.  

Today, Mr. Brown resigned his position.  He recently got a copy of all the 
evidence that Wendy and I planned to present, and many people (including the 
victim) received subpoenas this week for the trial.  I believe he finally 
realized the strength of our case and decided not to have all the dirty 
laundry aired at a public trial.  On your behalf, we filed an Executive 
Order today officially declaring his seat vacant. 

The State Attorney's Office has asked local law enforcement to make extra 
patrols by the residence of Mr. Brown and the victim to respond to any 
domestic violence that might arise from the resignation.  One of the reasons 
the victim did not want to cooperate was because of Mr. Brown's position as 
a County Commissioner.  If there is more violence, perhaps she will be more 
likely to cooperate since he is no longer a County Commissioner.

College affirmative action on trial
-----------------------------------------------------------------
(12/7/01 Chicago Tribune)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
CINCINNATI -- The University of Michigan held aloft the tattered flag of
affirmative action Thursday, defending its admissions policies before
federal judges who raised thorny questions about whether the school uses an
unconstitutional race-based quota system.

The hearing and its outcome could have far-reaching implications affecting
the racial makeup of the nation's top educational institutions.

The nine-judge 6thCircuit Court of Appeals heard arguments in two cases that
could significantly alter admissions policies at such schools as the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the University of Chicago and
Northwestern.

The cases involve admissions policies at the undergraduate college at the
University of Michigan's flagship campus in Ann Arbor and the Michigan law
school. They are virtually the only such cases still pending and are
expected to end up in the U.S. Supreme Court.

The judges asked whether an attempt to achieve racial diversity on campus
might become something like an unconstitutional quota system. The questions
went to the heart of the university's position, which is that the goal of
diversity is a compelling governmental interest that allows them to take
race into account in admissions.

Judge Danny Boggs, the most persistent questioner, said he was sympathetic
to the educational value of diversity but expressed concern that the
university's methods were just "a way of getting numbers."

At one point Boggs said a quota system restricting Jews to 15 percent of the
Harvard student body in the 1930s had been defended at the time as ensuring
that too many Jews didn't endanger Harvard's diversity.

John Payton, the lead counsel for the university, said Michigan's policies
are a way of getting a "critical mass" of qualified minority students so
they weren't isolated or defined by others as stereotypes.

In sparring that prompted courtroom laughter, Boggs asked whether Michigan
might logically award favorable admissions treatment to Southern Baptists if
it deemed they were underrepresented.

But Miranda Massie, an attorney representing students supporting the
university, responded that Southern Baptists might indeed warrant special
consideration if their lack of access to top quality education was a "major
impediment to social progress in our nation."

Hundreds of high school and college students, many of whom had come in
busses from Michigan, held a rain-soaked rally about affirmative action
about a block from the courthouse before the session began.

Affirmative action in higher education has been in retreat over the last
decade as courts have struck down school policies and states have pulled
back from previous programs.

California, Texas and Florida have replaced such policies with controversial
systems allowing a percentage of top high school students into the best
state schools.

But at many schools diversity remains a key goal and admissions offices use
race-based policies to achieve it.

"This is not just about the University of Michigan and this is not just
about public institutions, but all of higher education because every
institution takes race into account," said University of Michigan President
Lee Bollinger before the hearing.

Michigan officials argue that if they lose, recruiting programs targeting
minorities or "bridge" programs that help minorities become eligible for
admission, like one that exists at the University of Illinois, could be
ruled unconstitutional.

The two cases, both filed in 1997, were brought by Jennifer Gratz, a young
white woman denied admission as an undergraduate at Ann Arbor, and Barbara
Grutter, a white woman in her 40s who was rejected by the law school.

Different federal district judges ruled on them about a year ago. The Gratz
case judge upheld the university policy and the Grutter case judge ruled
against it.

Both cases depend heavily on interpretations of the 1978 Bakke decision of
the Supreme Court.

That ruling threw out quota systems for admitting minorities but has been
widely interpreted to mean that diversity is a compelling governmental
interest and schools can use race in admission decisions to further that
interest.

The Center for Individual Rights has challenged the methodology schools have
used to factor in race and the constitutionality of any use of race in
admissions, including for the purpose of fostering diversity.

The appeals court is expected to rule in months and the cases are being
closely watched in Illinois. "We make a major effort on the recruiting and
enrolling side to get as many students of color as possible," said Michael
Behnke, dean of college enrollment at the U. of C.

"The fear on our part would be a decision to ban the use of race in the
admissions process in any way."

that has been introduced by Miami-Dade County Commissioner Joe Martinez as
another alternative use for a portion of the Homestead AFB. The idea is to
use a portion of the site that now houses the airplane hangers for
production and post-production facilities. There is a group that has been
working on this idea for the past year. Please have someone contact me at

DATE: December 8, 2001 
RE: Critical issues for Florida Agriculture 

Thank you for the opportunity to provide an outline of critical issues facing Florida agriculture. I look forward to meeting with you Monday to discuss these matters. 


Country of Origin legislation. This consumer right-to-know issue is included in the House passed farm bill and in the farm bill presently being considered by the Senate. Representative Mary Bono and Senator Bob Graham are providing leadership with a broad base of support in each chamber. Consumers want to know where their food is grown for reasons of food safety and quality because of the wide variance in the environmental, pesticide and farm labor regulation in various countries. The legislation is patterned after the 1979 Florida Produce Labeling act. Opposition comes from food chains who profit from low cost imported fruits and vegetables. Cost of enforcement is minimal although opponents claim that enforcement would cost $60 million per year. This is a much exaggerated figure, but even if true, this would amount to 1 cent per consumer per week. This issue is extremely important to our winter vegetable growers 

Citrus canker. Adequate funding of USDA canker efforts and establishment of a policy for compensating losses from citrus canker based on a "grove acres" basis, not on a "net tree acres" basis, to include the additional acreage required by governmental regulation of land and water resources for operation of a commercial citrus business. Citrus canker is primarily a Florida problem. Also USDA/APHIS could send additional inspectors to Florida's ports of entry. 
Tomato Suspension Agreement. In 1996 the Florida tomato industry filed an antidumping suit against Mexican producers alleging dumping of tomatoes in the U.S. Market. The Department of Commerce found preliminary dumping margins. The Mexican Tomato industry and DOC reached an agreement under a suspension agreement. The suspension agreement is on its 5th year of enforcement. It is presently under sunset review by DOC. Almost since the beginning there have been enforcement problems with the agreement and Florida growers believe that the agreement has no teeth. A meeting of Secretary Don Evans with growers would go a long way toward resolving the differences that exist. 

Farmworker housing. Through the Governor's Farm Worker Housing Initiative, a $10 million federal grant was obtained from USDA from funds appropriated by Congress in response to the request of Governor Bush. Three projects are underway in areas of great need in Hillsborough and Lee County. The Florida Housing Finance Corporation has augmented this statewide effort to deliver affordable rural housing through community-based nonprofit developers. This significant federal/state initiative needs to be continued and expanded to benefit farmworkers and rural Florida. USDA could add $10 million additional to the regular yearly allocation for Florida to be leveraged by FHFC resources. 

Immigration reform. Support for compromise and passage of H-2A Reform and Agricultural Worker Adjustment Act, as proposed by Sen.Gordon Smith and Sen. Bob Graham. 
. 
Conservation. Increased funding of the conservation title of the farm bill, as an aspect of federal farm policy particular important to Florida and other Southern states. This includes the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) which assists willing landowners to restore wetlands that have been damaged by agricultural production, thus maximizing wildlife values.

Dear sir,
I was honored by attending your conference together with your brother
the 
President. I am very thankful to you for giving  your e-mail. Likewise,
I 
had the honor before of meeting your father when he obliged Saddam
Hussein 
to withdraw from Kuwait, the country in which I was living in for about
35 
years. I was born in Jordan in 1948, with a Lebanese nationality. I was
high 
school educated in Kuwait and I graduated from college in Madrid, Spain
in 
the field of tourism.  I was working with American Express, Burger King
and 
Marriott Vacation International Club in Kuwait. Whereas, I have
experienced 
many professional skills within human resources, customer servicing and 
sales and marketing. I was very much convinced about the  President's
demand 
of everyone of us to help the United States , the country of freedom and

democracy. That's why actually I am living here with my three kids who
are 
honor students.
I am very much ready to help your system in many ways. Allow me to tell
you 
what I can do and I will be proud to work for this nation in order to
give 
back the safety and the trust to the travel-related services field .
I am very convinced that I can do a lot to help the authorities in
achieving 
their aim due to the following:
I have the ability of identifying Arab natives  from their way of
talking, 
walking and given names, also I proved that I can tell from what
nationality 
is an Arab from the way he speaks with his dialogue-I speak fluently
Arabic, 
Spanish and English with fair knowledge of  Portuguese and French.
Furthermore, I believe that I could be a good asset in helping the
federal 
authority in setting up procedures, interpretations, determination and
carry 
out instructions to identify different cases and personalities of the
Middle 
East.
Mr. Governor , I am ready to start any time working with the FAA or any 
other authority part time voluntarily beginning in Orlando and traveling
to 
any other city if its needed and I am doing this frankly because I want
my 
honored student kids to continue living here learning the principles
based 
on freedom , indignity , democracy and equal opportunity which they will

find them only in USA.
       I look forward to have your instructions to enable me fulfill
with my 
commitment the soonest and I will appreciate given me this opportunity

Israelis Confess to Internet Attack


	
Updated: Sat, Dec 08 4:58 PM EST	

	
By LAURIE COPANS, Associated Press Writer 

JERUSALEM (AP) - Four Israeli youths in police custody have admitted to
creating and spreading the computer worm "Goner" by e-mail to attack
hundreds of users around the world, police said Saturday. 


Police arrested the high school students, ages 15 and 16, from the northern
city of Nahariya on Friday, said Meir Zohar, the head of the police computer
crime squad. 


The Internet worm first spread early this month to computers in Europe,
especially in France and Germany. American anti-virus companies have
reported more than 400 cases of Goner attacks worldwide. An Internet worm
can spread to other computers on its own. 



The Goner worm appears as an apparently harmless e-mail, with a subject line
of "Hi" and a note asking the recipient to open an attached screen saver,
which affects the computer if downloaded. The worm then spreads to all
addresses in the computer's e-mail system and through the instant messaging
program ICQ and Internet chat tools. 


Israeli police had been investigating the case for about a week, Zohar said.
One of the youths had admitted creating the worm and the other three
confessed to spreading it, he said. 


Under Israeli law, the suspects could face between three and five years in
jail if convicted, Zohar said.

Governor,
 
The TimeDirect system was originally developed in 1999 and the program
has been significantly enhanced since that time to respond to needs and
comments of our customers.  These enhancements include increased
accessibility for the system.  Some previous accessiblity issues with
the system were quickly resolved with an upgrade to the user's
accessibility tool.  The STO works closely with Julie Shaw and the ADA
Working Group to solve issues such as these, and, in checking with Julie
on this issue, she is not aware of any unresolved accessibility issues
with TimeDirect.  The email does not specifically mention any
accessibility problem but rather stresses the importance of testing the
system with the Bobby Program.  I will check on whether a new issue has
arisen.  However, the STO does not set its accessibility standard
relative to results from the Bobby Program.  The Bobby Program is not a
true measure of accessibility and is generally seen as an introduction
to the issue.  Many Web sites may pass a Bobby review and yet remain
inaccessible.   Again, we work closely with Julie and others on this
issue, and they do not recommend the Bobby approach.  For Web site
accessibility, our standard is Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act -
the current and significantly more comprehensive federal standard.
 
I understand the Department of Health issue has been ongoing since
November 2000.  Julie Shaw was made aware of the situation in October of
this year and brought it to the attention of the STO last month.  I
understand a work analysis evaluation has been performed by the Division
of Blind Services, the solution is now a top priority within DOH, and
the problem will be fixed in two to three months.  I am also working
with the CIOs to insert a "web accessibility" component into our
statewide applications procurement and development processes.  I will
continue to monitor this issue. 
 
If you would like to discuss further, please let me know.

Subject: STO and Bobby 



Dear Governor Bush: 

Thank you for forwarding my e-mail to the appropriate persons who handle
the 
Times Direct system.  I have spoken with Donna Livingston at DMS about
the 
issue and hopefully they will test the system with the Bobby program to
make 
it more accessible.  It may not cost a lot of money either since many of
the 
changes that the Bobby Program includes are simple.  I strongly
encouraged 
her to work on this problem since the state does not want to be put in a

position of looking as though it does not care if it complies with
federal 
laws.  The ADA is not a voluntary law.  I don't think the state can
argue 
hardship either because it knew before the system was purchased that the

Bobby program should be included and used to make it accessible. I don't

know why the STO did not check this before they bought the program.  

I have a friend who works for the Department of Health and she is having
the 
same problem with their statewide program used for case management.  The

department of Health was told before they ever purchased this case 
management program that it was not accessible to the disabled however,
they 
purchased it anyway. Since that department receives federal money they
are 
in an awkward position because they could be sued under several
different 
laws including the OFCCP and probably the DOJ. Ninety per cent of her
job is 
computer work and since they have installed this new program she is
unable 
to do her job because the entire program is icon based and totally 
inaccessible to blind persons who use speech programs.  It also uses a
blue 
screen which makes Braille displays unusable and prevents her from using
an 
Optacon which is an old device that people used to use to read displays 
before speech programs were created.  This lady, Ms. Elizabeth Bowden,
has 
worked with the Vocational Rehabilitation program for ten years and now 
because of this badly designed Department of Health Case Management
system, 
she will probably have to be moved to another position through no fault
of 
her own and will have to move from the job that she does very well.  She
is 
a VR Technician and has handled the job well until now. By the way, the 
Comptroller's office program for Employee Earnings Statement review
works 
very well and is totally accessible.   

I am letting you know these things, because  the STO is falling down on
the 
job in making the state's computer systems more efficient and user
friendly. 
Some of the staff  also have the attitude that its just not important
and 
we've never had a blind employee before so we just didn't know.   I
think it 
is very important especially when the state may be subject to being sued

when that is not necessary if precautions  are taken. Also,not having
had to 
deal with disabled employees before is not an excuse especially when
there 
are programs like Bobby available to assist in making programs
compliant. 

Sincerely, 

Linda Mathis

Subject: The "Newer Kinder" Medicare (CMS)


Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am writing this letter to comment on the "newer, kinder" Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services.  I certainly have not found them to be
any less frustrating than usual.
 
Have you looked at the Provider Application process lately?  We I have!
I am in process of completing an application for a physician who will be
joining our group soon.  When I signed onto the CMA website to print the
application, I was overwhelmed, to say the least, to find that one
section of the application was 57 pages long, one section was 67 pages
long, one section was 31 pages long and just the reassignment of
benefits form was 9 pages long.  Maybe you would not be intimated by the
sheer volume of these applications but a simple working person out here
in the trenches is.  It was my understanding that the new applications,
effective November, 2001, were simpler, clearer and easier. But looking
at these I sure don't feel that they are simpler, clearer and easier.  
 
I did receive The Florida Medicare B Update on Saturday, December 1
which included information regarding a "FREE" Provider Enrollment
Workshop to be held in Jacksonville, FL on December 13 or 14th.  It
stated that we should "Register Early, because "Seating is limited."
However, there was no phone number, fax number etc to facilitate that
happening.  When I finally did get a phone number for Provider Education
(not an 800# by the way) 904-791-6422 and I began calling on Monday,
Dec. 3 to register I was instructed to leave a detailed message.  I did
this including my phone number, fax number, and e-mail address where I
could be reached.  I noted that I needed confirmation that I would be
able to attend so that I could make travel and motel arrangements as I
am approx 6-7 hours away.  I have now made 26 long distance phone calls
as well as spending my time which is very valuable to me. By the time I
incur travel/hotel costs along with the time and phone calls, this
certainly will not have been "FREE" to me.  By Monday, if I were to get
a response by then, I will have only 2 days left to make arrangements to
attend. 
 
Let me stress, it is very important to me to attend this workshop!!
Having been through the application process several times previously
with disastrous results I was so excited to think that I might get my
"questions answered directly by a Medicare Expert" who will give me
"on-the-spot" assistance in completing and submitting my enrollment
applications.  
 
I have always supported you and felt that you were supportive of the
people in this state and the medical community.  I will certainly
appreciate it if you can offer any assistance to a small rural town
physician's office in your state.

Governor, good evening!  Yes, I was surprised also that Senator Mackay stated that it was Hank and his firm that did the plan for him. At our very first Council of Economic Advisors meeting, there was consensus that the current tax system of our state did not need major reform. This was based on a study that Council member Randy Holcombe of FSU completed. Randy has testified several times about his perspectives to the Tax Reform Commission. So Hank is on his owm on this one. You know my views a-) Current tax system has served the State well as tax receipts pretty much track the growth of the economy.  In the future we do need to continue lowering taxes on saving and inputs of production--the last thing we want to do is broaden the base as per Mackay's proposal.b) Discussing the Senator's proposal in this session only adds further uncertainty to an already uncertain economic outllook. c) The proposed reform sounds "good" from a revenue technical perspective only  (I can get you revenue neutrality anytime in a comparative static setting by broadening the base enough and lowering the rate). The problem are the adverse dynamic impacts on investment and economic growth that are not considered in this proposal.
I am sure Council can discuss at next meeting, Randy, Steve Morrell and I among others would be glad to testify in strong  opposition to the proposal. 
On a lighter note, How about my LSU tigers!!!! We avenged the Florida loss! Excuse the green tint in screen but I am in TJ's computer. Un abrazo, Tony Villamil.

Subject: Everglades Water Quality Standard



I spent much of yesterday in a briefing by DEP General Counsel Teri
Donaldson, Ernie Barnett, and Frank Nearhoof on what they represented to
me to be DEP's position regarding the Everglades phosphorus standard. 

Based on their briefing, I remain gravely concerned that what is about
to be proposed will have the following effects: 

* Initiate 3 years or more of gratuitous litigation. Instead of the
"best and brightest" at DEP and SFWMD being able to focus on how to
ATTAIN the standard already in the law (10ppb) their time and energies
will be dissipated by having to defend a rule to before an
administrative law judge. Since the 10ppb standard is ALREADY in the
law, there is NO value added here, only RISK. 

* Subject the formulation of a "compliance methodology" to the more
difficult standards of rulemaking rather than keeping it within the more
manageable confines of the permit process. The Everglades Forever Act
has NO directive to DEP that authorizes a rule on compliance
methodology. Compliance methodology is discussed in a SEPARATE
subsection of the Everglades Forever Act with NO authority to adopt a
rule attached to it (the Legislature easily COULD have granted DEP
rulemaking authority associated with the compliance methodology, but
chose not to). 

DEP has attempted to adopt rules under similar circumstances recently,
and has LOST rule challenges on similar points. See:

 State of Florida, Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust
Fund v. Day Cruise Association, 1st District Court of Appeal, September
13, 2001

I have not yet seen the draft rule language. In the briefing yesterday,
the DEP staff only showed me "bullet points"of what the rule would
contain on the points of the criterion (10ppb), compliance methodology,
and "net improvement" of impacted areas. 

Many of the "bullet points" sounded pretty good as to what the rule
would contain, but I can't assess them with certainty until I see the
actual rule language. 

However, no matter how good the draft rule appears on first blush, its
benefits will be illusory if they create an unnecessary new round of
litigation that the state is at risk of losing, or at best dissipating
its energies and public funds in over the next several years.

Far better course of action: 

*  Announce a decision to rely on 10ppb default standard in the law
because rulemaking to put the same number in a rule is redundant, and
exposes the state to unnecessary litigation.

* Deal with "compliance methodology" in long term permits as originally
envisioned by the Everglades Forever Act, which must be considered by
DEP in 2003.

Hi Jeb,
Below is a concern I've heard from many parents about these scholarships
from parents whose kids are blowing college and using this money for drugs.
They are very concerned that the checks go to the student.  Is there a
better way of handling these scholarships?

Dear Tinker
At the last FAD meeting you asked me to e-mail you this concern.  I thought
you might have the opportunity to point this out to the governor.
The easiest way to explain this is just to use my son as an example.
Andrew received a Bright Futures Scholarship and whatever is not used each
semester will be sent to him in the form of a check.  He has figured out he
will receive $1200 in Feb.  This is because we have the Florida Prepaid.  To
me it would be better if the money could only be used for college expenses
and the college would draw it out of an account with the student's name on
it.  It could be used for fees, books, or help with dorm expenses.  Whatever
isn't used goes back to the state of Florida and not to the student. Andrew
informed me the state is stopping the Bright Futures Scholarship, but  I
think this happens with all state scholarships.  My daughter received the
Gold Seal scholarship. She got a check each semester and blew it all which
in  total was $6000-$7000.  I believe many of these kids that receive this
money use it for drugs.  I will hope and pray when Andrew gets his, he uses
it in a responsible manner.   He says it will go in his savings for a car,
but who knows.
 Thanks for all you do,
 Carolyn Clarke

Dear Governor Bush:

I am not sure if you recieved this email, since you responded to the
first
one I sent both times. I send it again only for the very strong points
our
team has brought up on special session.

I know you must be extremely busy and I appreciate your timely response
to
my email. I also appreciate the attention you are paying to this very
important bill.

Our team has been reviewing the actions in Tallahassee with our legal
team
and other very interested parties around the country and would like to
ask
the following questions about the actions from earlier this week.

1: Due to the fact that the issue of the Florida Building Code was
outside
the purview of the call, doesn't the fact that President McKay allowed
this
bill to be heard during special session allude to special interest
activity
not in the best interest of the citizens of the state of Florida. As you
are
well aware this process started in 1996 with the building code study
commission. In 1998 the commission issued the single statewide building
code
and was agreed upon as being in the best interest of the state of
Florida.
It is now approaching 2002 and there are several states that have
adopted
building codes that incorporate hurricane protection, while our
legislature
has continuously delayed this very important code.

2: Many are questioning the legality of the actions taken during the
session
of the House pertaining to the delay of the Florida Building Code. Many
wonder if this was constitutionally correct.

3: Another point that has been brought to my attention is the language
in
the amendment to the Senate Bill 52C. The amendment states "design
professional who have been preparing construction documents in
anticipation
of the current Florida Law stipulating the implementation day for
January 1,
2002, may have their projects governed by the Florida Building Code that
would have been in effect". How can allowing this particular industry to
not
be financially affected by the delay, and other industries allowed to be
financially effected by the delay, not be a very harmful form of
discrimination.

As we are all aware right now more than ever, the safety and security of
our
families and children are of the utmost importance. The stringent
requirements of the new code, does nothing but enhance the safety and
security of our great state of Florida.

As I eluded to in my previous email, I ask once again for the
opportunity to
meet with you or speak to via telephone on this very important issue for
all
parties involved before you make judgment on this bill. There is a
solution
that everyone can be happy with.

Dear Governor Bush,

I am writing to express my disappointment and disbelief that The Senate
and
House has once again voted to delay the Florida Building Code. I wrote
to
you last week expressing my feelings and giving you an understanding of
what
the severity of this action means to our company, but I feel I must do
it
again, since you are the last possible chance I have to save my
business.

My name is Peter Merhige and my company is Protective Glass Industries,
located in Ft Myers, Florida. My company was formed over 2 years ago for
the
purpose of developing and bringing to market a new product for the
hurricane
protection markets. The reason for forming the company and products was
for
the potential in the hurricane markets mainly due to the
development of the new Florida building code (THE CODE IN WHICH YOU
AGREED
WAS GOOD FOR FLORIDA) that contains hurricane protection. We have
designed
and have patents pending on the finest impact glass product in the
industry.
Not only does it protect from hurricane damage but also due to it's
insulating properties, reduces the cost of energy. We have spent well
over
$1,000,000 on the development and commercialization of our products and
due
to several delays in the statewide building code; we have lost millions
of
dollars. Over the last 2 days, I have lost close to $1 MILLION in
investment
money because of the actions in Tallahassee. Not only has our company
spent
over $1,000,000 but also there has been millions and millions of dollars
already spent to develop this code, along with millions and millions of
dollars spent by companies to enhance their products to meet the new
codes.
There are hundreds of companies ready to provide product for these new
building codes and there has been more than ample time to prepare for
it.

I do not know how to make this any clearer than to tell you that all of
mine
and all of my loyal employees' hard work to develop our products and
bring
them to market over the last 2+ years is over unless you help. We had
the
potential to create over 100 jobs for the state of Florida with revenues
over $100 million dollars over the next 3 years, which would obviously
be
put back into the Florida economy while protecting your citizens. We
have
close to 20 companies that were getting set to come to market with our
glass
the first of the year because of your code, and due to the delay, they
will
not until March (if the code doesn't get eliminated all together). Due
to
this delay and the uncertainty of Tallahassee which makes my investors
uncomfortable enough to not invest, I will not be able to keep the doors
open. Your are really my last hope to see that Tallahassee actually
thinks
of it's citizens over their own personal agendas.

We worked very hard to present ideas that would make sense for everyone
and
had some really good suggestions, but because of obvious personal
agendas,
we were ignored. Presently Senators McKay, Clary and Constatine along
with
Representative Bennet, who have businesses in the construction industry,
stated that Florida's counties were not ready for the code. Ourselves,
The
Florida League of Cities, AIF and many more, have proof through the DCA
that
only 8% of Florida was not ready to enforce the code.

We suggested that all counties not ready be given a 60 day delay to get
prepared and the other 92% who have worked extremely hard to do what you
wanted, enforce the code as scheduled. I cannot, even in my worst
nightmares, imagine how this would not satisfy everyone if that was
their
true objections. Obviously it was not and Politics once again was
Politics.

As I stated, you are our last chance. We are not alone. There are many
companies that will be put out of business because of this action. I do
know
you have the power to make this right. I am begging you for the
opportunity
to meet with you to politely express the feelings and concerns of our
company and our industry before you sign the bill to put us out of
business.
I don't think this is an unfair request since Tallahassee has
potentially
stripped my life from me.

I hope to hear from you or your office soon.

Dear Gov. Bush: I have not heard from Mr. Stutler.  I realize other agencies have review authority regarding the HCP & the Section 10 permit.  I have been advised that your influence is what is needed to allow me to finish my seawall.  For two years I have been asking to do just that.  The alleged "take" created by my seawall is mitigated by the Section 10/Interim Agreement.  In my meeting with David Struhs and Mr. Stutler and their staff 4/30/01, Chairman Ginn & I were assured that there was no movement afoot to make approval of the Section 10 contingent on removing our project from coverage under the permit.  Chairman Ginn still has her doubts regarding that issue, but we have been further assured that eventually the Habitat Conservation Plan with the Section 10 will be approved & implemented.  With that assurance in mind, may I finish my wall?  The cost of completing the wall is one-half the cost of moving it a few feet.  I am asking you to intervene on our behalf.   This is complicated only if it is made so.  Thanks Again, Cheryl Gerstner

Dear Gov. Bush: Since January of 1997, I have been trying to complete my
seawall needed to protect what is left of my oceanfront property & my home
in Indian River Bounty. I have been in communication with you on this
matter since February 2000. As you may recall, this 5 year controversy is
over the position of the DEP that the wall is 15 feet too far seaward, and
therfore represents a "take" of turtle habitat. We have through your
efforts, those of local officials, and our own been given a permit to move
the wall as few as 8 feet. We continue to request that we be allowed to
complete the wall in its as-built location for several reasons. The primary
reason is the expense. At $850 a foot, it would cost $78,200 to move this
wall even 1 foot. Some quotes are as high as $1000.00 a foot. We have also
resisted moving the wall for reasons of value to our primary asset, because
we have documented the inconsistencies regarding the placement of permitted
wals elsewhere, and because we know that moving our wall is not going to
make a significant difference. The scuttlebut is that the unwillingness of
the decision makers to reach the obvious conclusion regarding the "Gerstner
Wall" is their fear of setting a precendent. It is not this decision that
willset a precendent; the inconsistent application of the rules and regs has
already established that "opening". What hasn't yet happened is a court
case to expose those Inconsistencies. Noone wants to be the one to take on
that task, and is it really necessary? Chairwoman Ginn if in Tallahassee
today and may contact you to make this same appeal. I know there are
agencies that could not tolerate a $100,000 budget cut. Please consider
what it represents to me and my family and weigh that cost against the gain.
You are acutely aware of the critical condition of our beaches. Seawalls
are only temporary structures that buy time until the conditions dictating
their need can be cured. We need sand by-pass srojects at inlets &
nourishing programs. I would not contact you again if I did not think it
was going to take your influence to get this done. Thank you, Cheryl

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
CONTACT: KAREN UNGER 
THURSDAY, DECEMBER 6, 2001 
850/224-4JEB 

TALLAHASSEE- During challenging times for our nation and state, Governor 
Jeb Bush and the Republican-led Legislature should be commended for 
their leadership and a successful special session. With the passage of a 
revised wartime budget, Governor Bush and the Republican-led Legislature 
have worked together to ensure that Florida's highest priorities are 
funded: 

 Education funding remains at historic levels - funding for K-12 
education has been increased during Governor Bush's tenure in office 
over $2 billion from where it was in 1998. 

 Health and human services funding, including child welfare and 
services to those in need, has increased by 31% percent since 1998. 

 Economic stimulus efforts will create 33,000 new jobs and boost 
Florida's tourism industry, still struggling as a result of the attacks 
on our nation, with $20 million for marketing campaigns. 

 $19 million in spending for various anti-terrorism and domestic 
security measures will equip our state's law and health officials with 
the tools they need to ensure that Floridians are safe. 

Even with wartime necessitated budget reductions, the state budget is 
still 20% greater than in 1998, with spending increases focused on our 
state's priorities - education, health and human services, public safety 
and the environment. Showing tremendous leadership in tough times, 
Governor Bush and the Republican-led Legislature joined together to 
overcome numerous challenges and get a difficult job done. 

The Democrat leadership and their candidates for governor, on the other 
hand, have served as mere spectators in the process. Their criticism of 
the budget and blaming of Governor Bush for the budget shortfall is 
ironic and hypocritical at best, given the facts: 

 The previous Democrat Administration left the state with a mere $1.3 
billion in reserves. Under Governor Bush's leadership, the reserves have 
been built to a record $2.9 billion - an increase of 120 percent. 
Anticipating harder times, the Governor vetoed $916 million in special 
projects to minimize Florida's spending obligations. Thanks to this 
incredible foresight and willingness to make the tough decisions, our 
state is in a position of greater financial strength. 

 Democrats in the Florida Legislature voted in favor of the last three 
budgets by 98% (1999), 100% (2000), and 89% (2001) - the same budgets 
they are now criticizing. 

 Over 90% of Democrats in the Florida Legislature voted in favor of the 
Intangibles Tax Cut in 1998, 1999, and 2000. 

"Being a leader takes more than criticizing from the sidelines. Being a 
leader means having the strength to offer realistic solutions and make 
the tough decisions," said Karen Unger, campaign manager for the 
Bush/Brogan 2002 campaign. "Governor Bush has lead. The Democrats have 
not."

COUPLE OF QUICK QUESTIONS........ 
S596.....IS THIS GOING THRU?  OFFICE OF LTC POLICY...GREAT!  YOU KNOW, I
WAS TRAINED ON HOW TO GET THE LAST DROP OF COVERAGE WHEN I CAME INTO
THIS BUSINESS...I, AM MASTER AT EXTENDING DAYS......ECONOMICALLY SOUND
MOVE FOR STATE......THE INDUSTRY WILL PLAY HARDBALL HERE, CLAIMING
BECAUSE THEY ARE LOSING DAY, THUS $$$, SO POOR CARE WILL RESULT....JUST
A SMOKE SCREEN... 

NEXT...S0216....ONLY HOSPITAL NURSES ARE MENTIONED....THIS IS NOT
RIGHT....THE LAW UPPED THE ANTE IN LTC ALSO,,,THE INDUSTRY SHOULD ALSO
BE MENTIONED.  THERE SHOULD BE AN AMENDMENT HITTING THE TEMPORARY
AGENCIES THAT ARE BASICALLY PERMITTING POOR QUALITY, FAST MONEY AND
OUTRAGEOUS RATE GAUGING TO PREVAIL...THIS IS WRONG.  WITHOUT MONITORING
AND REGS., THEY ARE HURTING THE PROFESSION IN THE STATE (NURSING, I
MEAN).  THEY ARE COSTING THE HOSPITALS, LTC AND HOME HEALTH UNBELIEVABLE
$$$'S WITH NO BACKUP OF QUALITY.  MOST LARGE LTC COMPANIES ARE NOT
ALLOWING THEIR BLDGS. TO USE, THUS STRAINING THEIR EXISTING STAFF AND
RUNNING CARE ON A SHOE STRING, RESULTING IN POORER CARE.  THIS I KNOW IS
TRUE. 

LAST QUERY.....PANEL ON PROBABLE CAUSE...AHCA BASED......THIS IS OUT OF
SUNSHINE?  A PROFESSIONAL CAN BE ACCUSED BY UNKNOWNS, FOR CAUSES KNOWN
ONLY TO THIS PANEL, WITH NO CHANCE TO REVIEW UNTIL AFTER CHARGES BY DOH
ARE BROUGHT?  SOUNDS LIKE A WITCH HUNT TO ME....AHCA AND DOH FOLKS ARE
NOT CAPABLE OF DETERMINING THIS PUBLICLY? 

WE WILL NOT SHARE OUR SECRETS, WE WILL NOT TIP OUR HAND!! 
LEAD, FOLLOW OR GET OUT OF THE WAY!!! 
GOD BLESS AMERICA!

Jeb: 

Well, I'll try to change the quality of input.  Everyone should get some 
positive feedback on a regular basis...you gave me enough at the Audubon 
event last month to last a full year (or two)! 

Sorry to hear that you can't make the Everglades Coalition meeting...any 
chance you can send a video (Bob Smith sent a great candid video last year).

I think it's important for you to continue to claim the high ground on your 
Everglades legacy...and the Coalition always requires positive feedback. 
Let me know what I can do to help with that.  

In your absence, we are asking Clay Shaw to speak at our reception on 
Thursday evening (January 3), along with Some State legislature folks. 
Should I (or you?) invite Trudi to represent you on behalf of the SFWMD? 
That would be a welcome touch with the assembled masses, as I believe they 
have great respect for her leadership as representative of your 
administration.

Subject:	RE: Florida Building Code

I cannot speak for the builders, nor will I say I understand their true
motivations behind their interest in delaying and eliminating the new
building code, but I do know, that they were part of the group that insisted
on 1 unified building code for the state.

My instincts tell me along with conversations I have had with many builders
in my area, that they will not build to the new standards unless made to or
asked to by the home owner.

As far as it being only a short delay, this will be the 3rd so called delay.
Another delay will only give the individuals in the Senate and House another
opportunity in January and February to push it back again, if not eliminate
it totally. I do not think we are truly speaking about delays, the
individuals will keep delaying and delaying this code until you say enough
is enough.

I mean this with absolutely no disrespect and hope you do not take it as
disrespect, but try to look at this from another angle. We work with window
companies all around the country who have spent millions and millions of
dollars in testing and product to make sure their products were able to be
sold in Florida per new code specifications. These companies have had it
with the indecision of our legislation and are growing more and more
frustrated with our process. Believe me when I say the companies we are
working with are the biggest and most powerful in our industry and for the
lack of kinder words, they are pissed about another delay because of the
money they have spent because our government said if they want to due
business in Florida, they have to make stronger products, and they have. How
much more of this will it take before Florida is in the National spotlight
again because 1 of these companies wants Florida to take responsibility for
the money they did not want to spend, but Florida said they had to.

How silly will Florida's political process look if we get hit with a storm
and as much as 1 home gets destroyed when our legislators have been pushing
their personal agendas over what I know you feel is in the best interest of
the safety and well being of all Floridians. You must VETO this bill because
the new building code is good.

I'm no politician but I think national headlines saying that Florida adopts
tougher statewide building code for hurricane and security reasons, could be
exactly what Florida needs to bring positive attention to the state and
bring people back vacationing.

Subject: Florida Building Code


Dear Governor Bush,

I am writing to express my disappointment and disbelief that The Senate
and
House has once again voted to delay the Florida Building Code. I wrote
to
you last week expressing my feelings and giving you an understanding of
what
the severity of this action means to our company, but I feel I must do
it
again, since you are the last possible chance I have to save my
business.

My name is Peter Merhige and my company is Protective Glass Industries,
located in Ft Myers, Florida. My company was formed over 2 years ago for
the
purpose of developing and bringing to market a new product for the
hurricane
protection markets. The reason for forming the company and products was
for
the potential in the hurricane markets mainly due to the
development of the new Florida building code (THE CODE IN WHICH YOU
AGREED
WAS GOOD FOR FLORIDA) that contains hurricane protection. We have
designed
and have patents pending on the finest impact glass product in the
industry.
Not only does it protect from hurricane damage but also due to it's
insulating properties, reduces the cost of energy. We have spent well
over
$1,000,000 on the development and commercialization of our products and
due
to several delays in the statewide building code; we have lost millions
of
dollars. Over the last 2 days, I have lost close to $1 MILLION in
investment
money because of the actions in Tallahassee. Not only has our company
spent
over $1,000,000 but also there has been millions and millions of dollars
already spent to develop this code, along with millions and millions of
dollars spent by companies to enhance their products to meet the new
codes.
There are hundreds of companies ready to provide product for these new
building codes and there has been more than ample time to prepare for
it.

I do not know how to make this any clearer than to tell you that all of
mine
and all of my loyal employees' hard work to develop our products and
bring
them to market over the last 2+ years is over unless you help. We had
the
potential to create over 100 jobs for the state of Florida with revenues
over $100 million dollars over the next 3 years, which would obviously
be
put back into the Florida economy while protecting your citizens. We
have
close to 20 companies that were getting set to come to market with our
glass
the first of the year because of your code, and due to the delay, they
will
not until March (if the code doesn't get eliminated all together). Due
to
this delay and the uncertainty of Tallahassee which makes my investors
uncomfortable enough to not invest, I will not be able to keep the doors
open. Your are really my last hope to see that Tallahassee actually
thinks
of it's citizens over their own personal agendas.

We worked very hard to present ideas that would make sense for everyone
and
had some really good suggestions, but because of obvious personal
agendas,
we were ignored. Presently Senators McKay, Clary and Constatine along
with
Representative Bennet, who have businesses in the construction industry,
stated that Florida's counties were not ready for the code. Ourselves,
The
Florida League of Cities, AIF and many more, have proof through the DCA
that
only 8% of Florida was not ready to enforce the code.

We suggested that all counties not ready be given a 60 day delay to get
prepared and the other 92% who have worked extremely hard to do what you
wanted, enforce the code as scheduled. I cannot, even in my worst
nightmares, imagine how this would not satisfy everyone if that was
their
true objections. Obviously it was not and Politics once again was
Politics.

As I stated, you are our last chance. We are not alone. There are many
companies that will be put out of business because of this action. I do
know
you have the power to make this right. I am begging you for the
opportunity
to meet with you to politely express the feelings and concerns of our
company and our industry before you sign the bill to put us out of
business.
I don't think this is an unfair request since Tallahassee has
potentially
stripped my life from me.

I hope to hear from you or your office soon.

Dear Governor Bush:

I am not sure if you recieved this email, since you responded to the first
one I sent both times. I send it again only for the very strong points our
team has brought up on special session.

I know you must be extremely busy and I appreciate your timely response to
my email. I also appreciate the attention you are paying to this very
important bill.

Our team has been reviewing the actions in Tallahassee with our legal team
and other very interested parties around the country and would like to ask
the following questions about the actions from earlier this week.

1: Due to the fact that the issue of the Florida Building Code was outside
the purview of the call, doesn't the fact that President McKay allowed this
bill to be heard during special session allude to special interest activity
not in the best interest of the citizens of the state of Florida. As you are
well aware this process started in 1996 with the building code study
commission. In 1998 the commission issued the single statewide building code
and was agreed upon as being in the best interest of the state of Florida.
It is now approaching 2002 and there are several states that have adopted
building codes that incorporate hurricane protection, while our legislature
has continuously delayed this very important code.

2: Many are questioning the legality of the actions taken during the session
of the House pertaining to the delay of the Florida Building Code. Many
wonder if this was constitutionally correct.

3: Another point that has been brought to my attention is the language in
the amendment to the Senate Bill 52C. The amendment states "design
professional who have been preparing construction documents in anticipation
of the current Florida Law stipulating the implementation day for January 1,
2002, may have their projects governed by the Florida Building Code that
would have been in effect". How can allowing this particular industry to not
be financially affected by the delay, and other industries allowed to be
financially effected by the delay, not be a very harmful form of
discrimination.

As we are all aware right now more than ever, the safety and security of our
families and children are of the utmost importance. The stringent
requirements of the new code, does nothing but enhance the safety and
security of our great state of Florida.

As I eluded to in my previous email, I ask once again for the opportunity to
meet with you or speak to via telephone on this very important issue for all
parties involved before you make judgment on this bill. There is a solution
that everyone can be happy with.

Respectfully,

Dear Gov. Bush: I have not heard from Mr. Stutler.  I realize other agencies have review authority regarding the HCP & the Section 10 permit.  I have been advised that your influence is what is needed to allow me to finish my seawall.  For two years I have been asking to do just that.  The alleged "take" created by my seawall is mitigated by the Section 10/Interim Agreement.  In my meeting with David Struhs and Mr. Stutler and their staff 4/30/01, Chairman Ginn & I were assured that there was no movement afoot to make approval of the Section 10 contingent on removing our project from coverage under the permit.  Chairman Ginn still has her doubts regarding that issue, but we have been further assured that eventually the Habitat Conservation Plan with the Section 10 will be approved & implemented.  With that assurance in mind, may I finish my wall?  The cost of completing the wall is one-half the cost of moving it a few feet.  I am asking you to intervene on our behalf.   This is complicated only if it is made so.  Thanks Again, Cheryl Gerstner

Subject: Gerstner Seawall: Indian River County


Dear Gov. Bush: Since January of 1997, I have been trying to complete my
seawall needed to protect what is left of my oceanfront property & my home
in Indian River Bounty. I have been in communication with you on this
matter since February 2000. As you may recall, this 5 year controversy is
over the position of the DEP that the wall is 15 feet too far seaward, and
therfore represents a "take" of turtle habitat. We have through your
efforts, those of local officials, and our own been given a permit to move
the wall as few as 8 feet. We continue to request that we be allowed to
complete the wall in its as-built location for several reasons. The primary
reason is the expense. At $850 a foot, it would cost $78,200 to move this
wall even 1 foot. Some quotes are as high as $1000.00 a foot. We have also
resisted moving the wall for reasons of value to our primary asset, because
we have documented the inconsistencies regarding the placement of permitted
wals elsewhere, and because we know that moving our wall is not going to
make a significant difference. The scuttlebut is that the unwillingness of
the decision makers to reach the obvious conclusion regarding the "Gerstner
Wall" is their fear of setting a precendent. It is not this decision that
willset a precendent; the inconsistent application of the rules and regs has
already established that "opening". What hasn't yet happened is a court
case to expose those Inconsistencies. Noone wants to be the one to take on
that task, and is it really necessary? Chairwoman Ginn if in Tallahassee
today and may contact you to make this same appeal. I know there are
agencies that could not tolerate a $100,000 budget cut. Please consider
what it represents to me and my family and weigh that cost against the gain.
You are acutely aware of the critical condition of our beaches. Seawalls
are only temporary structures that buy time until the conditions dictating
their need can be cured. We need sand by-pass srojects at inlets &
nourishing programs. I would not contact you again if I did not think it
was going to take your influence to get this done. Thank you, Cheryl

Pam,
 
Just wanted to drop you a line and give you an update on the impact of our Phase I support of the Visit Florida Tourism Initiative. As you know, we are supporting the Hot Deals Campaign with in-store signage (over 11,000 retailers statewide), a live draw vignette (aired during our statewide drawing broadcasts), and as a banner on our web page. Below is a current analysis of the web site link.
 
We scheduled to shoot the commercial for the PLay FLA USA scratch-off game this week. The concept is strong, and I believe it dovetails very well with the Governor's current PSA campaign. 
 
Just wanted to keep you in the loop.

Secretary Griffin,
 
Good morning.  I have great news about the Florida Hot Vacation Deals/flalottery.com link exchange program I want to share with you.
 
Just as a reminder, from 11/1/01, the first day of our link exchange program, through 11/8/01, flalottery.com sent an average of 155 visitors a day to the Hot Vacation Deals web site, for a total of approximately 1,240 visitors during that time period.
 
This morning, Chris Gasparro, of Miles Media, provided me with some updated figures on how much traffic flalottery.com has referred to the Hot Vacation Deals web site.  The news is very good!
 
Here are the details:
 
*	From 11/9/01 through 12/6/01, flalottery.com has sent a total of 4,162 visitors to the Hot Vacation Deals web site. 

*	From 11/9/01 through 12/6/01, flalottery.com is sending a daily average of 148 visitors to the Hot Vacation Deals web site. 

*	Our highest daily total referrals occurred 11/25/01, when flalottery.com sent Hot Vacation Deals 243 visitors 

*	Our lowest daily total referrals occurred on 11/27/01 (the Tuesday after Thanksgiving), when flalottery.com sent Hot Vacation Deals 94 visitors.  This low figure seems to be an anomaly.  I can provide you with detailed daily figures if it would be helpful. 

*	So far during December (12/1/01 - 12/6/01), flalottery.com is sending a daily average of 153 visitors to the Hot Vacation Deals web site.  Please note that this average is remaining relatively constant more than a full month into the link exchange program. 

*	As of 8:30 a.m. this morning, 12/7/01, we have sent 15 visitors to the Hot Vacation Deals web site. 
 
Other items of interest:  Since we have activated the short button banner on the main page, and added the FLA-USA links to all of our pages, the FLA-USA web site has leapfrogged flalottery.com in the Google search engine rankings for the general search term: florida.  Currently FLA-USA ranks fourth and flalottery.com ranks sixth (before the link exchange, it was the other way around).  Since the Google ranking algorithm considers links to a web site to be a major factor in relevancy, our numerous links to FLA-USA could be a major factor in their improved ranking.
 
In addition, I believe it is significant that the traffic we are sending to the Hot Vacation Deals web site is "targeted traffic."  In other words, people aren't just "surfing on in," but rather are clicking the Hot Vacation Deals link specifically because they are interested in visiting Florida.
 
Please let me know if you have any questions or if I can provide further information or assistance.

FYI, I understand that the Survey and Arrangement Committee of Hyundai
on
site selection has already reported to the Chairman that they do not
feel

their
opinion of Florida is that we are a state of retirees sunning on the

I am confident that Jeb can disprove this misconception when he reaches

I spent much of yesterday in a briefing by DEP General Counsel Teri Donaldson, Ernie Barnett, and Frank Nearhoof on what they represented to me to be DEP's position regarding the Everglades phosphorus standard. 

Based on their briefing, I remain gravely concerned that what is about to be proposed will have the following effects: 

* Initiate 3 years or more of gratuitous litigation. Instead of the "best and brightest" at DEP and SFWMD being able to focus on how to ATTAIN the standard already in the law (10ppb) their time and energies will be dissipated by having to defend a rule to before an administrative law judge. Since the 10ppb standard is ALREADY in the law, there is NO value added here, only RISK. 

* Subject the formulation of a "compliance methodology" to the more difficult standards of rulemaking rather than keeping it within the more manageable confines of the permit process. The Everglades Forever Act has NO directive to DEP that authorizes a rule on compliance methodology. Compliance methodology is discussed in a SEPARATE subsection of the Everglades Forever Act with NO authority to adopt a rule attached to it (the Legislature easily COULD have granted DEP rulemaking authority associated with the compliance methodology, but chose not to). 

DEP has attempted to adopt rules under similar circumstances recently, and has LOST rule challenges on similar points. See: 

 State of Florida, Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund v. Day Cruise Association, 1st District Court of Appeal, September 13, 2001 

I have not yet seen the draft rule language. In the briefing yesterday, the DEP staff only showed me "bullet points"of what the rule would contain on the points of the criterion (10ppb), compliance methodology, and "net improvement" of impacted areas. 

Many of the "bullet points" sounded pretty good as to what the rule would contain, but I can't assess them with certainty until I see the actual rule language. 

However, no matter how good the draft rule appears on first blush, its benefits will be illusory if they create an unnecessary new round of litigation that the state is at risk of losing, or at best dissipating its energies and public funds in over the next several years. 

Far better course of action: 

*  Announce a decision to rely on 10ppb default standard in the law because rulemaking to put the same number in a rule is redundant, and exposes the state to unnecessary litigation. 

* Deal with "compliance methodology" in long term permits as originally envisioned by the Everglades Forever Act, which must be considered by DEP in 2003.

Governor Bush,
   I wanted to take a moment to thank you for your efforts to increase
tourism to Florida in general and Walt Disney World in particular. I'm a
Disney stockholder and fan, so I benefit doubly when the company
thrives! I've also appreciated President Bush's comments encouraging
people to come visit. I believe Michael Eisner was down here in the same
timeframe as your visit, so you undoubtedly had the chance to speak with
him. Attendance in Disney's theme parks have been steadily picking up,
according to some friends I have who work there. I'm told that over the
Thanksgiving weekend, attendance at most of the parks was on par with
(or at least close to) last year's levels. The biggest problem is that
the occupancy rates at Disney's resorts--and the others in Orlando--are
so low. Still, at least we can see a light at the end of the tunnel.
   I also wanted to thank you for your leadership in helping us clear up
our concerns with the State Technology Office. While the issues haven't
yet been completely resolved (although I'm afraid STO may think they
have), the lines of communication have at least been opened. Dialog an
self-evaluation seem to be taking place, and that's a good thing. I'm
optimistic that the problems will be resolved once FIRN and STO can talk
a bit more.
   You might also be interested to know that I signed up through your
Web site to help the reelection campaign. I'm a long-time Republican; in
fact, I was the Treasurer of the Taylor County Young Republicans for
some time and have worked with Daryll Gunther quite a bit.
   Which leads me to my last point. THANK YOU for appointing Daryll as a
County Commissioner following the untimely death of Bea Foskey. I don't
know if Daryll has shared with you the sheer idiocy that tends to
surround our Commissioners and their actions. It's like a T.V. sitcom,
and would be comical if these goons weren't actually affecting the lives
of real people. Daryll is a breath of fresh air, and a voice of reason
on a ship of fools. He's not afraid to call a spade a spade, and I
appreciate it. He was an excellent choice, and has done an outstanding
job.

Hon. Governor Jeb Bush: 

Thanks for your support.  I was overwhelmed by the support shown for 
Transtar by the President, HUD Secretary Martinez, Mayor Hood, and you at 
the recent Town Hall Meeting.  However, the feedback from Thomas Butler of 
the SBA is that Transtar exceeds the size standards for small businesses.  
Therefore, the loan application that would provide the assistance necessary 
for Transtar to resume doing business at Orlando International Airport has 
been declined. 

I find myself asking for your urgent help in this matter.  Transtar was very 
important to this community, as it employed over 250 people.  The shutting 
down of Transtar had a direct impact on nearly 1000 individuals, not to 
mention Transtar's local suppliers and their employees. 

Transtar was dealt a deathblow by the events of September 11.  As you can 
imagine, time is of the essence.  Transtar faces several major challenges in 
the next few days.  Cancellation of the OIA contract is pending if no help 
is forthcoming. If the OIA contract is cancelled and the bond is called, it 
is not likely that Transtar or myself will ever be able to do business again 
with the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority.  Even with financial help to 
resume operations, Transtar faces additional challenges in structuring an 
ongoing relationship with GOAA. 

Over the past 16 years, I have more than demonstrated my ability to survive 
in a very difficult and competitive environment.  Before September 11, I 
built the business with personal resources and private sector financing.  I 
have never applied for government-backed assistance.  However, September 11 
created special needs, which require special solutions. 

Perhaps I can appeal for a special waiver in view of the employment 
represented by Transtar and its DBE status.  Perhaps there are other forms 
of state or federal aid that can mitigate this hardship.  There are many 
compelling reasons to support efforts to get Transtar back in business.  At 
this time I really need your guidance in dealing with this matter.  Governor 
Bush, I know that you are extremely busy, and your immediate attention of 
this matter would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks again for your support and 
guidance. 

Respectfully Yours, 
Robert T. Gaye

Dear Jeb,

meetings in Tallahassee, we have changed policy that requires a developer to 
be current on all loans before ever coming before the board for changes to 
existing deals or requesting new deals, 
found alternative sources of money to fund more affordable housing, and we 
have earned the respect of the developement community and the public.......we 
have come a long way baby. 

I hope that after the holidays, that your campaign will bring you to Broward 
County many, many times.  The die-hard democrats here will ignore all facts 
of your incredible leadership, equality, and positive legacy on Florida.   
They must meet you, know you, look into your eyes.  Only then may some

Hon. Governor Jeb Bush: 

Thanks for your support.  I was overwhelmed by the support shown for 
Transtar by the President, HUD Secretary Martinez, Mayor Hood, and you at 
the recent Town Hall Meeting.  However, the feedback from Thomas Butler of 
the SBA is that Transtar exceeds the size standards for small businesses.  
Therefore, the loan application that would provide the assistance necessary 
for Transtar to resume doing business at Orlando International Airport has 
been declined. 

I find myself asking for your urgent help in this matter.  Transtar was very 
important to this community, as it employed over 250 people.  The shutting 
down of Transtar had a direct impact on nearly 1000 individuals, not to 
mention Transtar's local suppliers and their employees. 

Transtar was dealt a deathblow by the events of September 11.  As you can 
imagine, time is of the essence.  Transtar faces several major challenges in 
the next few days.  Cancellation of the OIA contract is pending if no help 
is forthcoming. If the OIA contract is cancelled and the bond is called, it 
is not likely that Transtar or myself will ever be able to do business again 
with the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority.  Even with financial help to 
resume operations, Transtar faces additional challenges in structuring an 
ongoing relationship with GOAA. 

Over the past 16 years, I have more than demonstrated my ability to survive 
in a very difficult and competitive environment.  Before September 11, I 
built the business with personal resources and private sector financing.  I 
have never applied for government-backed assistance.  However, September 11 
created special needs, which require special solutions. 

Perhaps I can appeal for a special waiver in view of the employment 
represented by Transtar and its DBE status.  Perhaps there are other forms 
of state or federal aid that can mitigate this hardship.  There are many 
compelling reasons to support efforts to get Transtar back in business.  At 
this time I really need your guidance in dealing with this matter.  Governor 
Bush, I know that you are extremely busy, and your immediate attention of 
this matter would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks again for your support and 
guidance. 

Respectfully Yours, 
Robert T. Gaye 
Transtar Transportation, Inc.

Subject:	Bright Futures Scholarships

Hi Jeb,
Below is a concern I've heard from many parents about these scholarships
from parents whose kids are blowing college and using this money for drugs.
They are very concerned that the checks go to the student.  Is there a
better way of handling these scholarships?

Dear Tinker
At the last FAD meeting you asked me to e-mail you this concern.  I thought
you might have the opportunity to point this out to the governor.
The easiest way to explain this is just to use my son as an example.
Andrew received a Bright Futures Scholarship and whatever is not used each
semester will be sent to him in the form of a check.  He has figured out he
will receive $1200 in Feb.  This is because we have the Florida Prepaid.  To
me it would be better if the money could only be used for college expenses
and the college would draw it out of an account with the student's name on
it.  It could be used for fees, books, or help with dorm expenses.  Whatever
isn't used goes back to the state of Florida and not to the student. Andrew
informed me the state is stopping the Bright Futures Scholarship, but  I
think this happens with all state scholarships.  My daughter received the
Gold Seal scholarship. She got a check each semester and blew it all which
in  total was $6000-$7000.  I believe many of these kids that receive this
money use it for drugs.  I will hope and pray when Andrew gets his, he uses
it in a responsible manner.   He says it will go in his savings for a car,
but who knows.
 Thanks for all you do,
 Carolyn Clarke

Dear sir,
I was honored by attending your conference together with your brother the 
President. I am very thankful to you for giving  your e-mail. Likewise, I 
had the honor before of meeting your father when he obliged Saddam Hussein 
to withdraw from Kuwait, the country in which I was living in for about 35 
years. I was born in Jordan in 1948, with a Lebanese nationality. I was high 
school educated in Kuwait and I graduated from college in Madrid, Spain in 
the field of tourism.  I was working with American Express, Burger King and 
Marriott Vacation International Club in Kuwait. Whereas, I have experienced 
many professional skills within human resources, customer servicing and 
sales and marketing. I was very much convinced about the  Presidents demand 
of everyone of us to help the United States , the country of freedom and 
democracy. Thats why actually I am living here with my three kids who are 
honor students.
I am very much ready to help your system in many ways. Allow me to tell you 
what I can do and I will be proud to work for this nation in order to give 
back the safety and the trust to the travel-related services field .
I am very convinced that I can do a lot to help the authorities in achieving 
their aim due to the following:
I have the ability of identifying Arab natives  from their way of talking, 
walking and given names, also I proved that I can tell from what nationality 
is an Arab from the way he speaks with his dialogue-I speak fluently Arabic, 
Spanish and English with fair knowledge of  Portuguese and French.
Furthermore, I believe that I could be a good asset in helping the federal 
authority in setting up procedures, interpretations, determination and carry 
out instructions to identify different cases and personalities of the Middle 
East.
Mr. Governor , I am ready to start any time working with the FAA or any 
other authority part time voluntarily beginning in Orlando and traveling to 
any other city if its needed and I am doing this frankly because I want my 
honored student kids to continue living here learning the principles based 
on freedom , indignity , democracy and equal opportunity which they will 
find them only in USA.
       I look forward to have your instructions to enable me fulfill with my 
commitment the soonest and I will appreciate given me this opportunity

Jeb,

I watched you an hour or so ago, I believe Channel 6 Orlando, being ask
about the budget cuts.  You didn't seem as confident this evening as you
usually are when  reporters ask questions.  I realize live one on one
interviews are hard--I wouldn't even be able to talk--however you
typically
exhibit a stronger presence.

I also received the budget fact e-mail from Karen Unger this
afternoon--which is extremely important info to get out as I have seen
similar teacher union "fact" (har har) sheets this week already too.
Your
teams fact sheet begins with:
 Budget Fact Sheet

 Even with wartime necessitated budget reductions,.......

as simply an observation from someone who certainly isn't aware of all
facts
by any means, but do recall that before Sept. 11, Fl. was looking at
500-600
million in deficit shortfalls.  If I may suggest--don't let your team
get
carried away with casting our current shortfall too heavily on 9-11.
It's
just my opinion--but that would be a dangerous place to go.  Of course
it
has had a serious impact--but that wasn't our only problem that led to
it.
Your fact sheet on the democratic votes on the intangible tax and others
were very enlightening to me and I know will be to others as well--so I
suppose my point is--you have a great deal of good hard important work
you
have done to substantiate your positions and you don't need even the
appearances of throwing too much of the budget problem on wartime
downturns.
It will only fuel unnecessitated attacks from the left.  Just an opinion
from the cheap seats!

Take care and enjoy the weekend

Matt

Editorial: To cleanse Everglades, make standards tough 



The Palm Beach Post
Sunday, December 9, 2001



On Tuesday, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection will announce a number that should be no more than 10, as in 10 parts per billion. That figure should be the maximum amount of phosphorus -- found in runoff from cities and farms -- the state will allow in water that flows into the Everglades. 


In 1994, to settle the federal lawsuit over pollution entering Everglades National Park, the Legislature passed the Everglades Forever Act, a plan for restoring water quality to Florida's "river of grass." The first phase, designed to lower discharges to 50 parts per billion, has exceeded expectations. The second phase will set a permanent limit. 


The 10 parts per billion standard was set in the Everglades Forever Act. The Environmental Protection Agency approved the same limit 2 1/2 years ago for the portion of the Everglades that the Miccosukee Indians control. If the state recommends 10 parts per billion, as DEP Secretary David Struhs suggested in an interview Friday that it will, Gov. Bush's administration will agree with what most scientists have recommended for years. 


If the number seems certain, however, enforcement is not. Details of the proposal and of complex monitoring plans were not final as of Friday. DEP will deliver them Tuesday to the state Environmental Regulation Commission, which must make a final decision on pollution limits by the end of 2003. The EPA also will review the state's decision. 


Audubon of Florida had urged Mr. Struhs to do nothing before Dec. 31, non-action that under the Everglades Forever Act would have made 10 parts per billion the standard by default and made the legal challenge Mr. Struhs expects not a matter of administrative law. Opponents now can claim that the state is writing an improper rule to implement the Everglades Forever Act. In essence, the burden of proof shifts to the state. 


Among those Mr. Struhs expects to sue immediately over the tighter standards are farms and public utilities that discharge polluted water into the Everglades. Sugar farms and western areas such as Wellington and Weston routinely discharge water with phosphorus levels higher than 100 parts per billion. As recently as October, sugar growers suggested a standard of 20 to 30 parts per billion. 


Mr. Struhs defends DEP's decision by saying it is important for the state to go on the record. He is confident that his agency will win the lawsuit because, he says, the science is sound. Floridians will be able to share his confidence about the Everglades' future if the plan for enforcing the limits is strong and DEP leans on the South Florida Water Management District and its hundreds of permit-holders to comply.

Dear Mr. Governor;

	I have had the opportunity to be involved in many Hurricane
recoveries and
cleanup from Camille 1969-70 to Georges 1998-1999. As a practicing
Engineer in
public service for more than 35 years, I ask that you do what is
required to
NOT delay the implementations of the Florida Unified Building Code. The
people
of Florida should not be ask to adsorb the cost replacing the large
number of
building being built that will not survive the storms that visit us our
state.

	Delaying the new code is akin to not adding oil to your car when
the low oil
indicator is showing. The cost of the probable damage will far out weigh
cost
of a quart of oil. 

	The citizens of Florida need you to stand tall and firm in their
corner as a
voice of reason as others over react to events of the last few months.


	Thank you for your time and attention.

Hey, Jeb. It's Truly Burton. I see you are hanging in there with budget
cuts, economic issues, and the like. We are doing the same down here. 

This coming year, BASF's 2002 Program Committee is planning to invite
some dynamic, unique speakers for the Association's General Membership
meetings. We are planning on five major meetings this year with a
variety of highlight speakers. We would very much like for you to be a
featured "highlight" speaker. Since we are planning our calendar now, I
was hoping we could get you to come speak to us, perhaps in either May
or September. We had asked your Scheduler once before (about 12-18
months ago) if you could come talk with us, but that did not work out. 

As we look toward the campaign season, would a debate format/candidates
forum be equally interesting to you? We'd work with your campaign staff
for the right location, moderator(s), questions prepared in advance,
etc.  

Please let us know either way, as the Committee wants to finalize the
2002 calendar and we want to save you the best spot - you are our Number
1 pick! Best of the holiday season to you and your family. Best, Truly.

Jeb,

I watched you an hour or so ago, I believe Channel 6 Orlando, being ask
about the budget cuts.  You didn't seem as confident this evening as you
usually are when  reporters ask questions.  I realize live one on one
interviews are hard--I wouldn't even be able to talk--however you
typically
exhibit a stronger presence.

I also received the budget fact e-mail from Karen Unger this
afternoon--which is extremely important info to get out as I have seen
similar teacher union "fact" (har har) sheets this week already too.
Your
teams fact sheet begins with:
 Budget Fact Sheet

 Even with wartime necessitated budget reductions,.......

as simply an observation from someone who certainly isn't aware of all
facts
by any means, but do recall that before Sept. 11, Fl. was looking at
500-600
million in deficit shortfalls.  If I may suggest--don't let your team
get
carried away with casting our current shortfall too heavily on 9-11.
It's
just my opinion--but that would be a dangerous place to go.  Of course
it
has had a serious impact--but that wasn't our only problem that led to
it.
Your fact sheet on the democratic votes on the intangible tax and others
were very enlightening to me and I know will be to others as well--so I
suppose my point is--you have a great deal of good hard important work
you
have done to substantiate your positions and you don't need even the
appearances of throwing too much of the budget problem on wartime
downturns.
It will only fuel unnecessitated attacks from the left.  Just an opinion
from the cheap seats!

Take care and enjoy the weekend

Matt

We know that during times of national emergency the President of these United States and the Governors of all the states in the US have unusual power. We could shut down all state and federal government for Christmas week. Giving all workers the week off (LWOP) to spend time with their families etc. This cost saving /Job saving measure would keep people employed and prevent the need to increase taxes. The cities and counties in the US should allow their people off, or participate as well. All retailers should be encouraged to let their workers take one the following weeks off after Christmas week.

During this past week off we have worked on my mothers house, my friend's house, have done a little at my home, and have built up three computers for Project Hope to give away. We have spent between $500.00-$1000.00 dollars this week, all money going into the economy. Getting needed projects done, and at the same time helping others to keep their job by buying in the local stores. 

We still have to do a lot of shopping for Christmas presents. More people would shop and do home projects if they had the time off. "A million people @ one dollar per day, is one million dollars spent per day."

We cannot lay people off and cut spending in hope of bringing prosperity back. The economy is based on cash flow. An unemployed person does not have cash flow. My Father always said, "keep things simple".

When we leave the tax base as is-to keep from having to raise taxes later. And things improve, keep excess revenue for future down turn spending. "Save during the good times to spend during the bad times."

God Bless and have a Happy Christmas!

Kincaid this past Thursday.  Your personal reference to the fact that

that when you heard the piano playing in the White House you would think

My husband and I feel very fortunate to live in Florida where we have a

and listens to the "little people."

Our best wishes go out to you and your family this Holiday Season.

To the attention of Gov. Bush:

I - as well as several of my neighbors and fellow Floidians - find it
disconcerting that the FBI would completely ignore a citizen's request to
share information of potential imporatance. Our President has on several
ocassions voiced his recommendation that every American citizen be vigilant
during these recent post terrorism times to do the following.   He
encouraged us to report any suspicious activity that was in any way
potentially connected to terrorist activity domestically.

Having had a substantial background of experience with terrorist activity
and profiles in this hemisphere, I took the innitiative to call the FBI with
some information regarding a local leftist organization that has promoted
one of these Latin-American terrorist groups.  A group that has in fact
murdered American citizens.  My efforts were completely ignored with not
so-much as a returned phone call.  Just how serious do you think Americans
would take President Bush's council of being vigilant if our own FBI won't
even return a phone call concerning matters suggested by the President of
the United States!? .

By the way - I DO have credentials from known and prestigious think tanks
concerning my knowledge and experience with terrorists in this hemisphere.

I am available for any clarification.

Hon. Governor Jeb Bush: 

Thanks for your support.  I was overwhelmed by the support shown for 
Transtar by the President, HUD Secretary Martinez, Mayor Hood, and you at 
the recent Town Hall Meeting.  However, the feedback from Thomas Butler of 
the SBA is that Transtar exceeds the size standards for small businesses.  
Therefore, the loan application that would provide the assistance necessary 
for Transtar to resume doing business at Orlando International Airport has 
been declined. 

I find myself asking for your urgent help in this matter.  Transtar was very 
important to this community, as it employed over 250 people.  The shutting 
down of Transtar had a direct impact on nearly 1000 individuals, not to 
mention Transtar's local suppliers and their employees. 

Transtar was dealt a deathblow by the events of September 11.  As you can 
imagine, time is of the essence.  Transtar faces several major challenges in 
the next few days.  Cancellation of the OIA contract is pending if no help 
is forthcoming. If the OIA contract is cancelled and the bond is called, it 
is not likely that Transtar or myself will ever be able to do business again 
with the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority.  Even with financial help to 
resume operations, Transtar faces additional challenges in structuring an 
ongoing relationship with GOAA. 

Over the past 16 years, I have more than demonstrated my ability to survive 
in a very difficult and competitive environment.  Before September 11, I 
built the business with personal resources and private sector financing.  I 
have never applied for government-backed assistance.  However, September 11 
created special needs, which require special solutions. 

Perhaps I can appeal for a special waiver in view of the employment 
represented by Transtar and its DBE status.  Perhaps there are other forms 
of state or federal aid that can mitigate this hardship.  There are many 
compelling reasons to support efforts to get Transtar back in business.  At 
this time I really need your guidance in dealing with this matter.  Governor 
Bush, I know that you are extremely busy, and your immediate attention of 
this matter would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks again for your support and 
guidance. 

Respectfully Yours, 
Robert T. Gaye

I plan to investigate whether there is any flexibility in the SBA program to accommodate Transtar and/or if there are other programs that might assist.   I will confer with my team on Monday and be back in touch with you promptly with feasible options.  Until then, you can also contact me on (850) 487-2568.
 
Again, thanks for writing.

Hon. Governor Jeb Bush: 

Thanks for your support.  I was overwhelmed by the support shown for 
Transtar by the President, HUD Secretary Martinez, Mayor Hood, and you at 
the recent Town Hall Meeting.  However, the feedback from Thomas Butler of 
the SBA is that Transtar exceeds the size standards for small businesses.  
Therefore, the loan application that would provide the assistance necessary 
for Transtar to resume doing business at Orlando International Airport has 
been declined. 

I find myself asking for your urgent help in this matter.  Transtar was very 
important to this community, as it employed over 250 people.  The shutting 
down of Transtar had a direct impact on nearly 1000 individuals, not to 
mention Transtar's local suppliers and their employees. 

Transtar was dealt a deathblow by the events of September 11.  As you can 
imagine, time is of the essence.  Transtar faces several major challenges in 
the next few days.  Cancellation of the OIA contract is pending if no help 
is forthcoming. If the OIA contract is cancelled and the bond is called, it 
is not likely that Transtar or myself will ever be able to do business again 
with the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority.  Even with financial help to 
resume operations, Transtar faces additional challenges in structuring an 
ongoing relationship with GOAA. 

Over the past 16 years, I have more than demonstrated my ability to survive 
in a very difficult and competitive environment.  Before September 11, I 
built the business with personal resources and private sector financing.  I 
have never applied for government-backed assistance.  However, September 11 
created special needs, which require special solutions. 

Perhaps I can appeal for a special waiver in view of the employment 
represented by Transtar and its DBE status.  Perhaps there are other forms 
of state or federal aid that can mitigate this hardship.  There are many 
compelling reasons to support efforts to get Transtar back in business.  At 
this time I really need your guidance in dealing with this matter.  Governor 
Bush, I know that you are extremely busy, and your immediate attention of 
this matter would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks again for your support and 
guidance. 

Respectfully Yours, 
Robert T. Gaye

Jeb you are my buddy and I will always be there to help you and our cause.  I hope one day you will understand why I needed to speak on the floor last week.  I was taught early as a freshman that if you change your position on an issue or you will do the opposite of what you committed to do you let the other side know immediately and I did exactly that.  
 
Your leadership these past 3 years has been second to none and I am very honored to have you as a friend and Governor.  I look forward to the battles that are ahead of us  and yes, we will be together, always fighting the good fight.  
 
God bless you, my friend.

Bush's tax cut wins delay despite several GOP nays 
By ALISA ULFERTS 
 St. Petersburg Times, published December 6, 2001 
 
   TALLAHASSEE -- Lawmakers handed Gov. Jeb Bush the delay he sought in a controversial tax cut Wednesday, but it came without the support of some of the House's most conservative members.   TALLAHASSEE -- Lawmakers handed Gov. Jeb Bush the delay he sought in a controversial tax cut Wednesday, but it came without the support of some of the House's most conservative members.
   Repeatedly, Bush has been asked whether he had the 61 Republican House votes he wanted to delay a cut in the state's intangibles tax. Repeatedly, he has answered "Absolutely" or "We have the votes."
   In the end, Bush got 60 Republicans to vote for the delay. Seventeen other GOP lawmakers defected. Had all 43 Democrats joined the 17 Republican defectors in opposing the bill, it would have failed. Now, it will go to Bush for his signature.
   Bush insisted he could have delivered more Republicans, if he needed them. 
   "We were up to about 68 votes -- 60 very solid and eight who would have joined us" had it not become clear that the Democrats were going to support the delay, Bush said.
   "We had a lot of 61st votes," Bush said. 
   The House's 102-17 vote marks the first time Bush has lost more than a handful of Republican votes on any issue he wanted. The Senate earlier had approved Bush's bill 36-2.
   Rep. Connie Mack was among the young conservatives, informally dubbed the Freedom Caucus, who opposed Bush's plan. 
   "There were some of us that had a philosophical belief that this was not the right thing to do or the right time to do it," said Mack, R-Fort Lauderdale. He doesn't think Bush's failure to get 61 Republican votes reflects on the governor's standing within his own party.
   "He's been a leader on tax cuts. This shouldn't be made into "The governor's changed on the position of taxes,' " Mack said.
   Democrats supported the tax delay, but not before rubbing Republicans' noses in that fact. Delaying the cut will free up $128-million so budget cuts in the special session won't be so deep.
   House Democratic Leader Lois Frankel said the Democrats had considered voting against the tax delay as a strategy to pressure the Republicans who run the House to back off the budget cuts further. But the Democrats decided that wouldn't work.
   "We thought all that would happen is one of the 17 (nay votes) would have the noose around his neck" by voting for the delay, Frankel said.
   Bush stepped in to help broker a budget deal after the first special session he called to fix the budget collapsed when Senate President John McKay and Speaker of the House Tom Feeney failed to agree on the intangibles tax. Part of that agreement -- to be finalized today -- was to delay the latest round of the intangibles tax cut for 18 months to give the economy time to recover.
   McKay had wanted to repeal the tax cut entirely, and Feeney wouldn't even consider a delay. 
   Feeney joined 16 other Republicans in voting against the compromise. But he asked his lieutenants to help round up votes for Bush's compromise plan.
   "I candidly never knew whether we had 61 votes or not, but I worked closely with some of the Democratic members," Feeney said.
   Rep. Mike Fasano, who has popularized the phrase "seniors and savers" during his speeches opposing the intangibles tax on stocks and bonds, said he was impressed by Bush's abilities to garner 102 votes, even though his wasn't among those.
   "I'm convinced that if 61 Republican votes were needed on the floor, there would have been 61 votes. But it probably would not have been mine," said Fasano, R-New Port Richey.
   It's a point Bush agrees with. 
   "We probably had six people who, if they were needed, would have helped, maybe more," Bush said. "It shows we can forge a consensus and deal with problems. It was a good day for Republican leadership ... and tomorrow will be an even better day."

I would greatly appreciate if I could set up a meeting with you along with Carlos Alfonso, Wayne Chaplin,CEO and President of Southern Wine and Spirits, and Larry Goodrich to discuss the three tier distribution system. We would need no more than 30 minutes. They want to make sure you understand their position. I had a meeting with Brian Yablonski several weeks ago in Tallahassee and mentioned this to him.

Subject: Consumer contract scams


Dear Gov. Bush, 

I have become the victim of a scam involving a home alarm service which has an automatic annual renewal clause in the contract.  As a result of this event, it has made me aware that there are probably thousands of Florida residents who have also become victims of similar consumer contracts, so I would like to make a recommendation to provide a remedy to this situation. 

Specifically, I would like to recommend legislation which would require all "automatically" annual renewal invoices to be mailed to consumers BEFORE the renewal date with bold print stating that this contract is the result of an automatic renewal provision in your contract and the consumer has 30 days to notify the business provider if they wish to discontinue the contract. 

In my situation I had signed a contract for 3 years of alarm monitoring service for my residence.  At the end of the 1st and 2nd years I noticed that I received the renewal invoices about 30-60 days after the annual renewal date, but assumed this was an accounting or technology problem with the business, Alarm Depot of Miami, Florida.  After the 3rd yr. of service I again received the invoice about 45 days after the renewal date, so I telephoned the company and instructed them to discontinue the service (the sales rep. had initially told me that a telephone call would be all that was required to cancel the contract even though it states in the contract that this must be done in writing).   

Approximately a month later I received a call from the company in which they told me that I was past due on the invoice so I told them that I had already called and canceled the service.  At this time, I was told by the company rep. that this had to be done in writing and since it wasn't done in writing they could not cancel the service.  On Dec. 6th I received a call from a collection agency in which a very nice lady informed me that I was delinquent and threatened to ruin my credit if I did not pay.  I explained to her that I had canceled, so contacted the company to ask them and called me back to inform me that I had not canceled so they were threatening to sue me as well as place negative remarks on my credit reports. 

I called the company and spoke with Paul who he said I spoke with previously.  He told me that since I had not canceled the contract in writing PRIOR to the renewal date that the full contract amount was due and that he could not accept my cancellation verbally, as I had done attempted to do twice before when speaking with the company.  While he claimed that they have a responsibility to not take verbal cancellations due to someone mistakenly not having security service due to unauthorized cancellation, I counted that argument that this did not make sense due to the fact that the alarm company has passwords which could have been used to verify the authority of the person in which they were speaking. 

After spending a consider amount of time and aggravation on the phone with the company's representatives, I realized that this entire process is a scam to keep people in contracts for longer than they desire.  As a matter of fact, the renewal notice I received this year was also received the same day that I received a delinquency notice for this same invoice.  Furthermore, nowhere on the renewal invoice is there any text notifying customers that this is an "automatically" renewal of the contract, nor any disclosure that cancellation is required in writing BEFORE the renewal date.  Of course it will be impossible to a customer to cancel when renewal invoice is received since the renewal date has already passed. 

In my opinion, what should concern the lawmakers is the fact that this is a relatively small amount of money, i.e., $300, so I am sure that 99% of the customers who are pressed for collection just mail them a check to get collection agents and the company off their backs.  While my situation involves an alarm company, but I suspect that there are other service contracts used in this state that have similar terms which are designed to extract money from customers without their approval.  Hence, my recommendation that this legislation be applied to all consumer contracts in the state, especially for amounts under $500. 

For your investigation the name of this company is Alarm Depot and they are located at 9960 NW 116th Way, Suite 7, Medley, FL 33178 and their telephone number is 305-471-7950. 

Please keep me informed of any investigation results and any proposed legislative changes brought about as a result of this correspondence. 
Sincerely, 
Robert DuKate

 Governor, 

I recommend all the amicus briefs yield the oral argument to the Save Our Society brief.  The fact that you have filed an amicus brief is apparant (and weighty).  Only 20 minutes are given to each sides argument, no matter how many amicus briefs.  They have put up a former Supreme Court Justice; Save our Society has put up a former Solicitor General.  Let the legal mavens argue it out.

We (all of the amicus briefs on our side) have coordinated the arguments, and feel that one spokesperson can make the best case.

I believe we have the stronger hand.  And I believe by yielding the time to one speaker strengthens the substantive case even more, through the consistency of the interrelated points of law coming from one voice.

I also believe we are going to win this case.  Every professional organization involved in drug aspects of the criminal justice system and/or treatment are aligned against the proposition, with the exception of public defenders, and they are not aligned for it.  The backers of the amendment have not been able to break out a single treatment center to speak for it, and they have tried mightily.

Governor: 

As you know, we filed a brief in the Fla. Supreme Court on your behalf 
opposing the drug treatment initiative.  Oral argument is scheduled for 
Monday, Dec. 10 at 9:00 a.m.  We requested oral argument when the brief 
was 
filed in order to preserve the opportunity.  However, four of the five 
parties opposing the initiative -- including the EOG -- are scheduled to 

argue and have been alotted 5 minutes each.  The other parties' briefs 
-- 
especially that of Save Our Society from Drugs -- largely cover the same 

territory covered in our brief, although they make additional arguments, 
as 
well.  Because of the overlap, and because FDLE and the Prosecuting 
Attorneys Assn can adequately advance the concerns of the executive 
branch, 
we propose waiving or yielding our time to the other parties to best 
utilize 
the time given to the initiative's opponents collectively. 

Please let me know whether you agree or disagree.  Thank you.

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am writing this letter to comment on the "newer, kinder" Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.  I certainly have not found them to be any less frustrating than usual.
 
Have you looked at the Provider Application process lately?  We I have!  I am in process of completing an application for a physician who will be joining our group soon.  When I signed onto the CMA website to print the application, I was overwhelmed, to say the least, to find that one section of the application was 57 pages long, one section was 67 pages long, one section was 31 pages long and just the reassignment of benefits form was 9 pages long.  Maybe you would not be intimated by the sheer volume of these applications but a simple working person out here in the trenches is.  It was my understanding that the new applications, effective November, 2001, were simpler, clearer and easier. But looking at these I sure don't feel that they are simpler, clearer and easier.  
 
I did receive The Florida Medicare B Update on Saturday, December 1 which included information regarding a "FREE" Provider Enrollment Workshop to be held in Jacksonville, FL on December 13 or 14th.  It stated that we should "Register Early, because "Seating is limited."  However, there was no phone number, fax number etc to facilitate that happening.  When I finally did get a phone number for Provider Education (not an 800# by the way) 904-791-6422 and I began calling on Monday, Dec. 3 to register I was instructed to leave a detailed message.  I did this including my phone number, fax number, and e-mail address where I could be reached.  I noted that I needed confirmation that I would be able to attend so that I could make travel and motel arrangements as I am approx 6-7 hours away.  I have now made 26 long distance phone calls as well as spending my time which is very valuable to me. By the time I incur travel/hotel costs along with the time and phone calls, this certainly will not have been "FREE" to me.  By Monday, if I were to get a response by then, I will have only 2 days left to make arrangements to attend. 
 
Let me stress, it is very important to me to attend this workshop!!   Having been through the application process several times previously with disastrous results I was so excited to think that I might get my "questions answered directly by a Medicare Expert" who will give me "on-the-spot" assistance in completing and submitting my enrollment applications.  
 
I have always supported you and felt that you were supportive of the people in this state and the medical community.  I will certainly appreciate it if you can offer any assistance to a small rural town physician's office in your state.

Subject: The "Newer Kinder" Medicare (CMS)


Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am writing this letter to comment on the "newer, kinder" Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.  I certainly have not found them to be any less frustrating than usual.
 
Have you looked at the Provider Application process lately?  We I have!  I am in process of completing an application for a physician who will be joining our group soon.  When I signed onto the CMA website to print the application, I was overwhelmed, to say the least, to find that one section of the application was 57 pages long, one section was 67 pages long, one section was 31 pages long and just the reassignment of benefits form was 9 pages long.  Maybe you would not be intimated by the sheer volume of these applications but a simple working person out here in the trenches is.  It was my understanding that the new applications, effective November, 2001, were simpler, clearer and easier. But looking at these I sure don't feel that they are simpler, clearer and easier.  
 
I did receive The Florida Medicare B Update on Saturday, December 1 which included information regarding a "FREE" Provider Enrollment Workshop to be held in Jacksonville, FL on December 13 or 14th.  It stated that we should "Register Early, because "Seating is limited."  However, there was no phone number, fax number etc to facilitate that happening.  When I finally did get a phone number for Provider Education (not an 800# by the way) 904-791-6422 and I began calling on Monday, Dec. 3 to register I was instructed to leave a detailed message.  I did this including my phone number, fax number, and e-mail address where I could be reached.  I noted that I needed confirmation that I would be able to attend so that I could make travel and motel arrangements as I am approx 6-7 hours away.  I have now made 26 long distance phone calls as well as spending my time which is very valuable to me. By the time I incur travel/hotel costs along with the time and phone calls, this certainly will not have been "FREE" to me.  By Monday, if I were to get a response by then, I will have only 2 days left to make arrangements to attend. 
 
Let me stress, it is very important to me to attend this workshop!!   Having been through the application process several times previously with disastrous results I was so excited to think that I might get my "questions answered directly by a Medicare Expert" who will give me "on-the-spot" assistance in completing and submitting my enrollment applications.  
 
I have always supported you and felt that you were supportive of the people in this state and the medical community.  I will certainly appreciate it if you can offer any assistance to a small rural town physician's office in your state.

Governor Bush: 
At your suggestion during our initial meeting I am contacting you  regarding an insurance industry group interested in meeting with you again. To refresh your memory, an AIG directed group met in your office over a year ago to discuss opportunities with the state utilizing an Owner Controlled Insurance Program related to statewide increased minority contracting and surety support. 

Our success with this model compels us to again seek an audience with you and several senior executive representatives from AIG's New York office along with representatives from the national Insurance Brokerage firm of Willis from Florida wish to discuss new opportunities. We are prepared to brief you on new Insurance programs as they relate to public project construction funding and minority contractor utilization. Our schedules are open the first two weeks of January. 

I am a new resident of South Florida and have become more aware of the importance of this issue in Florida. This initiative may help you in providing resources for educational facilities and other public projects without the investment of state capital. We believe it is timely for a private-public collaboration on this issue. I look forward to discussing this opportunity with you soon. You may reach me via this e-mail,  or my office number is (954) 577-1082, or you may also reach me at my cell phone number: (954)-895-1488.

Dear Mr. Governor;

	I have had the opportunity to be involved in many Hurricane recoveries and
cleanup from Camille 1969-70 to Georges 1998-1999. As a practicing Engineer in
public service for more than 35 years, I ask that you do what is required to
NOT delay the implementations of the Florida Unified Building Code. The people
of Florida should not be ask to adsorb the cost replacing the large number of
building being built that will not survive the storms that visit us our
state.

	Delaying the new code is akin to not adding oil to your car when the low oil
indicator is showing. The cost of the probable damage will far out weigh cost
of a quart of oil. 

	The citizens of Florida need you to stand tall and firm in their corner as a
voice of reason as others over react to events of the last few months.


	Thank you for your time and attention.

Good morning Governor Bush,
  Hope everything is fine for you today.  Well we were told by the District 1 Developmental Disabilities office that all the special projects for districts 1,2,and 4 will cease as of Dec. 10th this year.  This is a sad, sad time for the Great State of Florida, and for families with handicapped children and adult children.  I am afraid that our state institutions for the handicapped will soon be crowded beyond belief because some parents will have no choice with their supports removed but to remand their handicapped children over to DCF facilities.  We were also told that all cost plans for individuals will be cut by $150.00.  for some individuals that is their whole cost plan, and that cuts in cost plans will be even higher is some other districts.  That all personal care attendants will be cut, another reason DCF's will become crowded.
I know these are hard times, and everyone need to bite the bullet so to say but to ruin the lives of individuals with handicaps and their families, it's just a very hard pill to swallow.
Sir is there anything I can do to help as an individual and in my capacity as chairman of the Family Care Council in District 1?
I would be more than willing to help any anyway. I have been ask to speak at the CAFE this year that is if we have one, and was wondering what would be a good subject to speak on that can be encouraging to our families during this time.  Thanks for listening to me again sir and please have a nice day.  Your friend, Darrell Walker

Dear Governor Bush:

My son participates in subject pilot and has received speech and

has not cost much. We have worked within or near his original budget by
dropping his assigned coordinator and providing most of his
transportation ourselves. We have also supplemented state funding with
our own funds and insurance for therapy.  This pilot has made our family
take on the rightful responsibility for our son's development instead of
leaving it to the State.  I had no idea how much I could help Drew
myself until he entered the program.

I appreciate all the hard work of so many people which has made this
pilot possible and urge you to veto any unwise attempts to reduce
funding for it in this time of fiscal hardship.  I believe this will be
a money saving program in the long run.

Dear Jeb, 

        We spoke last April about the possibility of your attending the inaugural opening of the Naples Botanical Gardens on Saturday evening, February 13, 2002 in Naples. Since it was far too early for you to commit, you asked me to contact you as we got closer to the event. I spoke to Mr. Jimison today, and he is going to put the date in the computer, but he explained to me that your schedule really remains open and flexible until six weeks prior.

        He also suggested that I e-mail you to remind you about the event, so you could contact him about scheduling it into your calendar if you are interested. Naples and the surrounding area is a very affluent region. The property for the Botanical Gardens (150 acres worth $5 million) was donated by a single Naples resident. The additional money (millions of dollars) has also been donated by the residents of Naples.

        Mr. Jimison suggested that a fundraiser held by the Party, scheduled during that time frame, might make your stop in Naples more persuasive. I have therefore contacted Mike Hanna, and am faxing a copy of this e-mail. As further incentive, my husband and I would be honored to have you stay with us in our Naples home. We live on the golf course, so perhaps you could relax for a few hours, get in a round of golf on a beautiful course and/or do a little fishing. Our next-door neighbor is the president of the Gardens, so you would also have the opportunity to meet her.

        Jeb, your appearance at the event would mean so much to the Gardens and to the people of Naples -- and, of course, I always enjoy speaking with you. Please try to come.

        I look forward to hearing from you. 

                                                                        Sincerely,

850/224-4JEB 

TALLAHASSEE- During challenging times for our nation and state, Governor 
Jeb Bush and the Republican-led Legislature should be commended for 
their leadership and a successful special session. With the passage of a 
revised wartime budget, Governor Bush and the Republican-led Legislature 
have worked together to ensure that Florida's highest priorities are 
funded: 

 Education funding remains at historic levels - funding for K-12 
education has been increased during Governor Bush's tenure in office 
over $2 billion from where it was in 1998. 

 Health and human services funding, including child welfare and 
services to those in need, has increased by 31% percent since 1998. 

 Economic stimulus efforts will create 33,000 new jobs and boost 
Florida's tourism industry, still struggling as a result of the attacks 
on our nation, with $20 million for marketing campaigns. 

 $19 million in spending for various anti-terrorism and domestic 
security measures will equip our state's law and health officials with 
the tools they need to ensure that Floridians are safe. 

Even with wartime necessitated budget reductions, the state budget is 
still 20% greater than in 1998, with spending increases focused on our 
state's priorities - education, health and human services, public safety 
and the environment. Showing tremendous leadership in tough times, 
Governor Bush and the Republican-led Legislature joined together to 
overcome numerous challenges and get a difficult job done. 

The Democrat leadership and their candidates for governor, on the other 
hand, have served as mere spectators in the process. Their criticism of 
the budget and blaming of Governor Bush for the budget shortfall is 
ironic and hypocritical at best, given the facts: 

 The previous Democrat Administration left the state with a mere $1.3 
billion in reserves. Under Governor Bush's leadership, the reserves have 
been built to a record $2.9 billion - an increase of 120 percent. 
Anticipating harder times, the Governor vetoed $916 million in special 
projects to minimize Florida's spending obligations. Thanks to this 
incredible foresight and willingness to make the tough decisions, our 
state is in a position of greater financial strength. 

 Democrats in the Florida Legislature voted in favor of the last three 
budgets by 98% (1999), 100% (2000), and 89% (2001) - the same budgets 
they are now criticizing. 

 Over 90% of Democrats in the Florida Legislature voted in favor of the 
Intangibles Tax Cut in 1998, 1999, and 2000. 

"Being a leader takes more than criticizing from the sidelines. Being a 
leader means having the strength to offer realistic solutions and make 
the tough decisions," said Karen Unger, campaign manager for the 
Bush/Brogan 2002 campaign. "Governor Bush has lead. The Democrats have 
not."

Well, I'll try to change the quality of input.  Everyone should get some 
positive feedback on a regular basis...you gave me enough at the Audubon 
event last month to last a full year (or two)! 

Sorry to hear that you can't make the Everglades Coalition meeting...any 
chance you can send a video (Bob Smith sent a great candid video last year). 
I think it's important for you to continue to claim the high ground on your 
Everglades legacy...and the Coalition always requires positive feedback. 
Let me know what I can do to help with that.  

In your absence, we are asking Clay Shaw to speak at our reception on 
Thursday evening (January 3), along with Some State legislature folks. 
Should I (or you?) invite Trudi to represent you on behalf of the SFWMD? 
That would be a welcome touch with the assembled masses, as I believe they 
have great respect for her leadership as representative of your 
administration.

Dear Governor Bush, 
I've heard you speak at the Family Cafe and I know your passion to 
support persons with disabilities.  Noah, our 23 year son, has severe 
disabilities and is medically unstable.  At the past Cafe I heard you 
speak on the Choice and Control pilot project.  Noah participates in 
this 
program and I was on the committee to set up the pilot for our District 
in the Tallahassee area.  I understand this project is facing severe or 
total cuts in the budget the legislators have given to you for signing. 
Our family urges you to line item veto this.  The Project gives us the 
first opportunity in many years to provide Noah with the goods and 
services he requires.  That means he can continue to live at home with 
his family.  If he had to live in a state funded facility it would cost 
over $100,000 a year--more than 5 times what the state is currently 
spending on the Choice and Control Pilot Project for him.  Please help 
us keep our family together.  Please e-mail me if you require more 
information. 
Thanks for your consideration, Susan, Fred and Noah Redmon

You are right to focus on readiness and the state is doing some good things in this regard. We spend $700 + million on the subject, are building an assessment tool and I am urging further private sector investment since I know there is real interest there. 
 
I applaud the Sentinel's interest in this subject. I hope the paper keeps the heat up and gets many more citizens involved as well. 
 
However, the social promotion acceptance is pathetic. 
 
Para terminar, me siento herido por tus palabras sobre me accento! :) Colu sigue siendo una maestra excelente!

Thanks for taking the time out of your very busy day to respond. I hope to use some of what you've written in a column, though I'm going a different route in my assessment of what's wrong in the system. I believe you're right on target about ending social promotion, and the districts not doing what they should. But I think true reform would start all kids in pre-K because the earlier the better, particularly for disadvantaged kids who don't get reading at home, etc. It's become fashionable for middle-class and upper-middle class parents to "hold back" Johnny in pre-K for a year to get him really prepared and "mature" for kindergarten, and private schools retain kids all the time in pre-K and kindergarten. I've seen it over the years at St. James. I know your K-20 plan doesn't cover pre-K and that program, which never has received adequate funding, now falls to day care groups. I talked to Phil Handy about it when he came to speak to the ed board about the new education structure, but he said it's something that's on the table and open for discussion. 
 
Well, the dinner turned out lovely. I noticed that the group's awards to public officials all went to Republicans. Sheriff Beary was there and Rep. Ric Keller sent his Hispanic outreach guy, Joe Mantilla.(Keller also sent a video and blamed you for his rotten Spanish -- teehee). Crotty sent a video, too. The GOP is working harder than the Dems around here... but you may have heard that already. I did notice that your accent on the tape was more noticeable. Que pasa .. no estas practicando con Columba?
 
One last note re Reading by 9. The paper really is committed, and I think part of that is that you have an editor and a managing editor at this paper now who both have young children attending public schools. (And I've got one in public high school) That says something about their commitment and the stake they have in Florida's public education system. By the way, I have volunteered along with about a dozen others at the paper to be a tutor for the Reading by 9 program at a nearby school for at least nine weeks. I look forward to it.
 
Hope to catch you next time your in Orlando.

Miriam, I am obviously not at the dinner and committed to be there. 
 
On social promotion, the FCAT is but one criteria. Sadly, many districts are lacking the courage to hold back students and remediate. It is a shame and a quiet scandal. However, our proposed enhancements of the grading system will help focus the districts on the kids left behind. If approved in the next weeks, if schools ignore the kids that are struggling, they will be penalized. 
 
In addition, based on the districts' non compliance with the intent of the A plus plan, there is the strong possibility of legislative reforms to tighten the requirements regarding social promotion. I would support reasonable reforms in this regard. 
 
I really appreciate the efforts of the Orlando Sentinel in advancing the cause of reading and student achievement. It is and will continue to make a difference. No other paper is focused on this and your involvement will have a statewide impact.

I plan to be at the Hispanic ministers dinner tonight to hear your speech, and I hope you have a minute to talk to me about the social-promotion issue and how school districts are ignoring the requirement to hold back fourth graders who fail the FCAT. Some of the educators I've interviewed in Orange County feel it's wrong to hold kids back based mostly on the results of one test. My understanding is that the test is one of many factors, but it does carry a lot of weight in the decision. Is that accurate? Also, how many times can a child re-take the FCAT? Any?

If you won't have the time for a brief couple questions  from me tonight on this topic, would you have a minute to respond via email? Thanks, Myriam

Hon. Governor Jeb Bush: 

Thanks for your support.  I was overwhelmed by the support shown for 
Transtar by the President, HUD Secretary Martinez, Mayor Hood, and you at 
the recent Town Hall Meeting.  However, the feedback from Thomas Butler of 
the SBA is that Transtar exceeds the size standards for small businesses.  
Therefore, the loan application that would provide the assistance necessary 
for Transtar to resume doing business at Orlando International Airport has 
been declined. 

I find myself asking for your urgent help in this matter.  Transtar was very 
important to this community, as it employed over 250 people.  The shutting 
down of Transtar had a direct impact on nearly 1000 individuals, not to 
mention Transtar's local suppliers and their employees. 

Transtar was dealt a deathblow by the events of September 11.  As you can 
imagine, time is of the essence.  Transtar faces several major challenges in 
the next few days.  Cancellation of the OIA contract is pending if no help 
is forthcoming. If the OIA contract is cancelled and the bond is called, it 
is not likely that Transtar or myself will ever be able to do business again 
with the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority.  Even with financial help to 
resume operations, Transtar faces additional challenges in structuring an 
ongoing relationship with GOAA. 

Over the past 16 years, I have more than demonstrated my ability to survive 
in a very difficult and competitive environment.  Before September 11, I 
built the business with personal resources and private sector financing.  I 
have never applied for government-backed assistance.  However, September 11 
created special needs, which require special solutions. 

Perhaps I can appeal for a special waiver in view of the employment 
represented by Transtar and its DBE status.  Perhaps there are other forms 
of state or federal aid that can mitigate this hardship.  There are many 
compelling reasons to support efforts to get Transtar back in business.  At 
this time I really need your guidance in dealing with this matter.  Governor 
Bush, I know that you are extremely busy, and your immediate attention of 
this matter would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks again for your support and

Subject: Florida Building Code


Dear Governor Bush,

I am writing to express my disappointment and disbelief that The Senate and
House has once again voted to delay the Florida Building Code. I wrote to
you last week expressing my feelings and giving you an understanding of what
the severity of this action means to our company, but I feel I must do it
again, since you are the last possible chance I have to save my business.

My name is Peter Merhige and my company is Protective Glass Industries,
located in Ft Myers, Florida. My company was formed over 2 years ago for the
purpose of developing and bringing to market a new product for the hurricane
protection markets. The reason for forming the company and products was for
the potential in the hurricane markets mainly due to the
development of the new Florida building code (THE CODE IN WHICH YOU AGREED
WAS GOOD FOR FLORIDA) that contains hurricane protection. We have designed
and have patents pending on the finest impact glass product in the industry.
Not only does it protect from hurricane damage but also due to it's
insulating properties, reduces the cost of energy. We have spent well over
$1,000,000 on the development and commercialization of our products and due
to several delays in the statewide building code; we have lost millions of
dollars. Over the last 2 days, I have lost close to $1 MILLION in investment
money because of the actions in Tallahassee. Not only has our company spent
over $1,000,000 but also there has been millions and millions of dollars
already spent to develop this code, along with millions and millions of
dollars spent by companies to enhance their products to meet the new codes.
There are hundreds of companies ready to provide product for these new
building codes and there has been more than ample time to prepare for it.

I do not know how to make this any clearer than to tell you that all of mine
and all of my loyal employees' hard work to develop our products and bring
them to market over the last 2+ years is over unless you help. We had the
potential to create over 100 jobs for the state of Florida with revenues
over $100 million dollars over the next 3 years, which would obviously be
put back into the Florida economy while protecting your citizens. We have
close to 20 companies that were getting set to come to market with our glass
the first of the year because of your code, and due to the delay, they will
not until March (if the code doesn't get eliminated all together). Due to
this delay and the uncertainty of Tallahassee which makes my investors
uncomfortable enough to not invest, I will not be able to keep the doors
open. Your are really my last hope to see that Tallahassee actually thinks
of it's citizens over their own personal agendas.

We worked very hard to present ideas that would make sense for everyone and
had some really good suggestions, but because of obvious personal agendas,
we were ignored. Presently Senators McKay, Clary and Constatine along with
Representative Bennet, who have businesses in the construction industry,
stated that Florida's counties were not ready for the code. Ourselves, The
Florida League of Cities, AIF and many more, have proof through the DCA that
only 8% of Florida was not ready to enforce the code.

We suggested that all counties not ready be given a 60 day delay to get
prepared and the other 92% who have worked extremely hard to do what you
wanted, enforce the code as scheduled. I cannot, even in my worst
nightmares, imagine how this would not satisfy everyone if that was their
true objections. Obviously it was not and Politics once again was Politics.

As I stated, you are our last chance. We are not alone. There are many
companies that will be put out of business because of this action. I do know
you have the power to make this right. I am begging you for the opportunity
to meet with you to politely express the feelings and concerns of our
company and our industry before you sign the bill to put us out of business.
I don't think this is an unfair request since Tallahassee has potentially
stripped my life from me.

I hope to hear from you or your office soon.

Respectfully,

Peter Merhige

As you know, REACT was asked to assist in gathering information on the
impact of Red Tide on oyster harvesters in the Apalachicola Bay area.
This information would then be used to help substantiate a request for a
Presidential Declaration. As discussed in the conference call today,
Linda Heiberger of DCA had previously contacted Andy Gill of USDOL
regarding Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA).  

In my  conversation with Andy on today, he could not recall an instance
where DUA had been approved in the past in response to  Red Tide. Andy
specifically mentioned that he worked with North Carolina officials for
over a two-year period with Red Tide and their request was never
approved.  However,  Andy did imply that the situation maybe somewhat
different here in Florida and encouraged us to continue with submitting
the request.  At this point, my assessment is that we will need the
support of your office and the Florida Congressional Delegation to
obtain federal approval for DUA.  We are virgously gathering information
to support the declaration request. However,  I wanted to share the
results of my conversation with Andy prior to the Thursday Town Hall
meeting.

Thanks.

RE:       AMI Resolution
 
The Board of Directors of the Business Development Board unanimously approved the following Resolution supporting AMI and encouraging the company to remain in Palm Beach County.  The resolution is intended to convey to the company the business community's support and to counter any misconceptions arising from negative comments appearing in recent media articles.
 
We are asking each member to review the recitals and the resolution carefully, and send an email of support to Mr. David Pecker, CEO of AMI today.  His address is dpecker@AMILINK.com.
 
We feel this company has experienced substantial harm from a tragedy that affected all Americans.  A decision to move this company to another location because of a belief they are not supported by our "business community" would deal a serious blow to our economy.  Most importantly, we need to convey the message that an individual does not represent the feelings of our community and the act of lending support to employees and management in difficult times is our sincere objective. 
 
 Thank you in advance for a favorable action of this request
 
 
 
 
RESOLUTION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE
BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT BOARD OF PALM BEACH COUNTY
 
 
This Resolution is adopted this 7th day of December, 2001, by the members of the Board of Directors of the Business Development Board of Palm Beach County, Inc.

R E C I T A L S

WHEREAS, AMI is a business domiciled in Palm Beach County, Florida, employing three hundred ninety (390) employees with an average salary of $65,000.00; and
WHEREAS, AMI has been subjected to an extraordinary tragedy of financial and personal impact; and
WHEREAS, an offer of financial assistance by the Board of County Commissioners of Palm Beach County was a gesture of support by the County - not a request by AMI for funds;  and AMI never threatened to move if Palm Beach County did not offer grants; and
`WHEREAS, AMI expressed appreciation of the offer of assistance, and AMI agreed to repay any Palm Beach County funds if insurance reimbursement or federal assistance was received by AMI; and 
WHEREAS, recent articles in the Palm Beach Post have suggested that one individual believes that the business community should not be supporting AMI; and
WHEREAS, the members of the Board of Directors of the Business Development Board care for and support the individuals, officers and directors of AMI and the business of AMI, and support the long term location of AMI within Palm Beach County, Florida.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED:
1.         That the Business Development Board of Palm Beach County expresses its regret and condolences for the tragic circumstances which have affected the individuals, business and operations of AMI.

Dear Tim:
Thanks for the e-mail and I am very sorry not to be able to attend the
Monday meeting but I have to teach docs about emergency preparedness in
Jupiter on Monday.
I serve as an Alternate AMA delegate for the FMA and was surprised to
witness the AMA efforts to educate physicians (see attached press release).
The members of our delegation were convinced that the AMA models its
approach according to Florida's experience.
Nearly a dozen speakers presented topics including biological and chemical
terrorism, disaster preparedness and the management of posttraumatic stress
disorder resulting from the events of 911.
Most speakers emphasized that disaster preparedness is a local problem and
need to be dealt with accordingly.
Hospitals, physicians and the local community need to coordinate their
readiness planning and training exercises.
It is crucial that we closely direct and supervise:
1) development and implementation  of emergency readiness plans at each
healthcare facility (doctors offices)
2) guide local hospitals in emergency readiness planning and to provide
templates.
3) coordinate training exercises at local hospitals and other community
based sites (shopping malls, movie theatre etc.) involving local healthcare
professionals.
4) local public education and awareness campaign utilizing community
newspapers and local radio and TV stations.

The FMA delegation also introduced a resolution calling for a national
smallpox vaccination initiative and a modified resolution passed the House
of Delegates.
============================================================================

AMA Press release:

AMA Interim Meeting features major educational effort on bioterrorism;
public service announcement aimed at millions
Fulfilling its vital role in educating physicians on recognizing and
responding to biological attacks, the AMA is devoting a major portion of its
Interim Meeting in San Francisco this week to discussions related to
bioterrorism. Included in the mix: more than seven hours of educational
sessions  some offered for continuing medical education credit -- intended
to deepen physicians clinical and professional skills on the subject. The
AMA plans to make the information available via the Internet to all
physicians in the nation following its meeting.

Bioterrorism is one of the most important issues facing Americas patients
and physicians right now, said AMA President Richard Corlin, MD. With our
Interim Meeting bringing together physicians from across the country and
across the medical spectrum, there is no more appropriate forum to tackle
this issue and forge the medical response strategies and solutions that can
protect Americas patients against this threat.

As part of the effort, the AMA this week is releasing a national television
public service announcement (PSA) directing the public to their family
physician and the AMA Web site for up-to-date information on biological and
chemical terrorism.

The PSA is part of a comprehensive AMA program to educate patients and
physicians on how to respond to biological and chemical attacks. The best
antidote to public anxiety is full, accurate information, said Dr. Corlin.
Our job is to deliver that information so patients and doctors can respond
to rapidly changing circumstances.

In the national TV spot, Dr. Corlin tells viewers, In a world where
biological terrorism has become a reality, many Americans are confused. For
timely information, go where doctors go, the AMA Web site. Learn why not to
stockpile medicines, especially antibiotics, and why a flu shot is just for
the flu, and nothing else. And remember, for sound medical advice, trust
your family physician. Good medical information can protect your family 
and protect our way of life.

The broadcast announcement will be distributed this week by satellite to
television news and public affairs directors. In addition, all AMA
physicians will soon receive a CD-ROM with clinical information on
biowarfare threats such as anthrax and smallpox, plus details on hospital
preparedness and the medical management of biological and chemical
casualties.

The bioterrorism agenda at the Interim meeting included a videotaped speech
by Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson and an address from
Surgeon General David Satcher, MD, who thanked the AMA and the House for the
work theyve done to address bioterrorism education. The satellite
conferences that we [the CDC] have cosponsored with the AMA have reached
more than a half million physicians in the country -- and without your
leadership, that would not have been possible, he said. Clearly it is the
kind of interaction that needs to be ongoing as we work together to
strengthen the public health infrastructure.

Jeb,

I watched you an hour or so ago, I believe Channel 6 Orlando, being ask
about the budget cuts.  You didn't seem as confident this evening as you
usually are when  reporters ask questions.  I realize live one on one
interviews are hard--I wouldn't even be able to talk--however you typically
exhibit a stronger presence.

I also received the budget fact e-mail from Karen Unger this
afternoon--which is extremely important info to get out as I have seen
similar teacher union "fact" (har har) sheets this week already too.  Your
teams fact sheet begins with:
 Budget Fact Sheet

 Even with wartime necessitated budget reductions,.......

as simply an observation from someone who certainly isn't aware of all facts
by any means, but do recall that before Sept. 11, Fl. was looking at 500-600
million in deficit shortfalls.  If I may suggest--don't let your team get
carried away with casting our current shortfall too heavily on 9-11.  It's
just my opinion--but that would be a dangerous place to go.  Of course it
has had a serious impact--but that wasn't our only problem that led to it.
Your fact sheet on the democratic votes on the intangible tax and others
were very enlightening to me and I know will be to others as well--so I
suppose my point is--you have a great deal of good hard important work you
have done to substantiate your positions and you don't need even the
appearances of throwing too much of the budget problem on wartime downturns.
It will only fuel unnecessitated attacks from the left.  Just an opinion
from the cheap seats!

Take care and enjoy the weekend

Another Whats going on in Lake Panasoffkee, Governor Bush? 
Some time ago the Blade asked this same question. Its appearance on the web aroused the ire of some individuals, so in the thinking of this editor it was believed some education benefits toward what public disclosures can provide was accomplished. Due to a number of recent questions being raised by some Lake P citizens, however, maybe the belief was similar to the old adage of yelling against the wind? 
To recap, the state legislature some two years ago said in passing a Bill that was to provide about $26 million dollars over five years (paraphrased here) that the Lake was a state treasure owned by all its citizens, and the sad, man mangled mess needed restoration before it was totally lost. A lake restoration committee set-up began, that to shorten a long involved session of political finagling, ended up as being less in number of members as originally planned by governor appointment, all placed in office by the local county commission. Not unexpected, some well-known local power players, according to citizen activists, ended up in a majority of those seats that has guided matters ever since. 
Their first project decided upon was to restore sections on the lakes east side around Colemans Landing, an uninhabited shore a far piece for any boat trailering, that had public access right of way and was at one time a prime fishery area. Unfortunately, due to contentions that native aquatic plants must be allowed to repopulate the dredged areas, public access there is still a figment for future decision. Waterfront dwellers on the west shore where a major Sumter County population resides are mad. Especially canal property owners who cant get anything done, once privy to clean, clear runs to open water but now landlocked by excess weeds and muck buildup, are not happy to know that as a practical matter, only fish camp owners and their customers for the most part are reaping any benefits from this cost-overrun, millions of dollars operation. Some fish camp owners they point out who set on the restorations committee. 
Recently the chorus of questioners has widened and deepened apparently. It now is being noised about that as dredging activity has been transferred to the west side of the lake, clearing of the channel from one of said fish camps to open water, and a open lakefront restoration along another committee members property ongoing, is stirring real heat to an already hot mix. A mix that embroils state and county money, hard to track according to these activists with agencies like Swiftmud and the Fish and Game Department trying to roil the pot on the side. 
Yep, Governor! If any parts of the above are true, Id say you and some others got a big problem. Come to think of it, even the perception evidently affecting a bunch of folks, smells pretty bad in these volatile times. What do you say? LCA[] 

Governor Bush: A letter advising the Attorney Generals office of criminal actions in the above program from a Mr. Knute Dobson of Lake Panasoffkee has been copied to me as the Citrus-Sumter Blade editor. Complaint is made this notification is being ignored by the AG. Could your office look into these matters? L. C. Alexander[]

Dear Governor Bush:

Please allow me to introduce myself.  My name is Randy James and I am 
Chairperson of the Communities and Schools program in Hillsborough County.
I am writing you because I was distressed to hear that the CIS State 
allocation in the last special session has a proposed 50% reduction from 1 
Million Dollars to $500,000.  

As CIS of Florida's Budget was already cut by 2/3rds from $3 million to $1 
million in this year's regular session, I feel that we are shouldering more 
than our share of cuts.  I appreciate the difficult situation that you and 
the legislature are in and we are prepared to accept our share of cuts.  
However, I do not understand why we are being asked to take a considerably 
larger cut than most other programs that I have reviewed.  

I respectfully request that you reconsider allowing such a large cut to 
become law.  CIS of HIllsborough alone serves some 5,000 at risk students and 
these continuing cuts are putting an incredible strain on our ability to 
continue to serve this important class of students.

Thank you for taking the time to review my concerns and please let me know if 
there are any questions that I can answer about this issue.

Sincerely:

If you engage in any conversations with casa blanca over the weekend, might
want to relay issue on economic stimulus package.

everyone knows package is in trouble

based on calls that nina and i have been on, biggest sticking point with
governors -- today raised by gov. taft and hull on conference call with paul
o'neil -- is the accelerated depreciation component.  the administration is
calling for a 30% depreciation up front.  it impacts states b/c this is a
change to the federal corporate income tax calculation -- states'
calculations are tied to the federal calculation (sort of like estate tax).
Our guys are projecting a $200 million hit annually for 3 years to the state
budget if this goes through.

bottom line is, many states are having to go through special session like we
have had to and are worried about the additional hit to the state budget.

it is an issue that is keeping governors from endorsing the presidents plan
or advocating for it -- it has been the subject of every economic stimulus
conference call i have been on with the white house, and i heard the
governors at the RGA meeting a couple weeks ago all were up in arms about
it.

on all conference calls with white house on the issue and most recently
today's call with Paul O'Neil, the response from the administration has been
weak -- non responsive or philosophical in nature.

suggestions: 	make it a federal tax credit -- that wont impact state
calculations -- white house will say economic stimulus will not be as
great doing it this way
		lower depreciation component -- even lowering it to 10%
would cost florida $70 million.

Agere Systems, Inc.

Allentown, PA  18109
 
Dear John:
 
It was a pleasure speaking with you regarding Agere Systems and the valued relationship your company maintains with the State of Florida.  The investments Agere has made in business expansions and job creation in Florida has contributed to greatly to our economy.  Equally important has been your company's role as a partner in economic development programs-from participation in the Florida High Tech Corridor to providing chairs at the University of Central Florida and the University of South Florida.
 
Fully recognizing the difficult times facing your industry, I want to emphasize that Florida's commitment to fostering the growth of technology-based industry clusters remains steadfast.  Florida has partnered with your company in the past, and we are ready to do so again to ensure your continued success-particularly in research and development realms.
 
With a focus on the optoelectronics and photonics, there are particularly unique opportunities for Agere to excel in Florida.  As you may be aware, the University of Central Florida (UCF) is recognized as among the top three schools in the nation (if not world) for optical science and engineering, and it's Center for Research and Education in Optics and Lasers (CREOL - www.creol.ucf.edu <http://www.creol.ucf.edu/> ) is in class amongst itself.   Beyond espousing incredible research, UCF and CREOL are producing optoelectronics graduates highly sought in the private sector-many of whom have assumed employment at Agere.  With an obvious shared vision, it would seem very advantageous for UCF to work closely with Agere Sytems to build upon research and development programs that will lead to model innovations.  
 
I have asked John Hitt, UCF President to contact your office to strategize on how UCF and CREOL can best incorporate Agere into its varied research and development programs.   Perhaps this could include relocation of some of Agere's optoelectronics programs presently based in New Jersey.  From both a vantage of academic excellence and financial feasibility, I am confident that Florida could greatly benefit Agere Systems in its continued growth plans.
 
Until then, I wish you all the best and welcome you to contact me whenever I might be of assistance.
 
Sincerely,
 
 
Jeb Bush

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I would not normally contact you with the details of the goings on in our community, but I think that I am a target for a Scientology scam.
 
My name is Mary O'Meara and I am the president of S.P.A.R.C. of Volusia, Inc. (Special Population Activities & Recreation Council). We are a 501 (c) 3 Florida non-profit, and our organization provides recreational, athletic, social and educational activities for mentally challenged people in Volusia County. I live in New Smyrna Beach, and our group has been experiencing the growth and wonder of the success of reaching anyone and everyone who can benefit from our activities. We are hoping that in the future we can establish a community center to serve a lot of needs. I was planning to start writing grants for funding in 2002. We have over 150 "participants", whose age range is 3-65 who represent a myriad of disabilities.
 
My concern is that we saw an e-mail for seed money to open an "ABLE Center" and I jumped at the opportunity to learn more about it. ...Long story short, I have arranged for a meeting with Lori Bennett, "Ambassador of Hope" as she regards herself, to speak to the parents and care-givers of my group. I have recently been made aware that she may represent the Church of Scientology. Although asked many direct questions about religion and funding, Lori has never given me a direct answer. She has claimed that the seed money does not come from Federal or State funding, that it does not come from any form of grant, and that she will only disclose where the funds come from at our meeting. This meeting is scheduled for December 12th at Coronado Community United Methodist Church's "Beach Club" at 7pm. You are invited if you'd like to attend!
 
I have spent the better part of the day speaking with my attorney, surfing the internet looking for any information I can get. I was hoping to find a direct tie between the A.B.L.E. Foundation and Scientology, but I cannot find one. I have, however, received e-mails stating that some people KNOW the tie to be there. As a result I have e-mailed my mailing list and will follow up with a post card tomorrow telling ALL that I am only hosting, not backing, this organization. I have urged my families NOT to sign anything. I am a recognized and trusted entity in my county and want to keep on doing what I'm doing - it's needed and I truly enjoy it. Here's the thing: I am afraid that she will bully my desperate parents into something, or that she will make my life difficult if I don't comply with her... The information I digested regarding Scientology is horrifying, and I am actually personally afraid at this point. 
 
I am hoping for some input, advice or reassurance - who knows what - mostly because I feel that all of my work can be ruined in one fell swoop. Do you have any information on this church in Florida? Lori Bennett is the CEO of "The A.B.L.E. (Achieving Beyond Limited Expectations) Foundation, Inc,  - as it's worded in the Division of Corporations website - and her family members are the other directors. She lives in Williston, Florida. There is some connection with Illinois, as our meeting invitations came from zip code 60499 in South Suburban Illinois - although when I asked her about the postmark she did not answer my question satisfactorily. I am hoping that we can stop this before other counties are possibly taken advantage of also. I have included the ABLE website and hope that perhaps your office can look it over thoroughly... it seems to say a lot while saying very little, and yet I felt obliged to investigate it as something of a possibility for our county. http://www.ablefoundation.org
 
My contact information is as follows: I live at 321 Roslyn Avenue, New Smyrna Beach, FL 32168 - 
My phone number is 386-409-9292, and my e-mail is msosparc@ucnsb.net. 
 
I thank you in advance for any input you can provide.

Importance:	High

Dear Governor
 
Sorry,  I didn't mean to lose you the big bet. You are correct in terms of exports alone.  The  Dominican Republic is our # 3 export  destination after Brazil and Venezuela if measured by the conventional merchandise trade method, which is based on what goes out of our ports and airports.  If we focus on origin exports, which are export transactions that originate in-state, Dominican Republic would be # 4 after Brazil, Canada and Mexico.
 
However as a trading partner meaning two way trade, Dominican Republic would be second only  to Brazil, which I guess makes Pam $5 - richer.
 
Best regards,
 
Manny

 Governor, 

I recommend all the amicus briefs yield the oral argument to the Save Our Society brief.  The fact that you have filed an amicus brief is apparant (and weighty).  Only 20 minutes are given to each sides argument, no matter how many amicus briefs.  They have put up a former Supreme Court Justice; Save our Society has put up a former Solicitor General.  Let the legal mavens argue it out.

We (all of the amicus briefs on our side) have coordinated the arguments, and feel that one spokesperson can make the best case.

I believe we have the stronger hand.  And I believe by yielding the time to one speaker strengthens the substantive case even more, through the consistency of the interrelated points of law coming from one voice.

I also believe we are going to win this case.  Every professional organization involved in drug aspects of the criminal justice system and/or treatment are aligned against the proposition, with the exception of public defenders, and they are not aligned for it.  The backers of the amendment have not been able to break out a single treatment center to speak for it, and they have tried mightily.

Governor: 

As you know, we filed a brief in the Fla. Supreme Court on your behalf 
opposing the drug treatment initiative.  Oral argument is scheduled for 
Monday, Dec. 10 at 9:00 a.m.  We requested oral argument when the brief 
was 
filed in order to preserve the opportunity.  However, four of the five 
parties opposing the initiative -- including the EOG -- are scheduled to 

argue and have been alotted 5 minutes each.  The other parties' briefs 
-- 
especially that of Save Our Society from Drugs -- largely cover the same 

territory covered in our brief, although they make additional arguments, 
as 
well.  Because of the overlap, and because FDLE and the Prosecuting 
Attorneys Assn can adequately advance the concerns of the executive 
branch, 
we propose waiving or yielding our time to the other parties to best 
utilize 
the time given to the initiative's opponents collectively. 

Please let me know whether you agree or disagree.  Thank you.

Again, with all due respect sir, when you challenged me in front of God, country, and Tallahassee TV crews, the bet was whether the Dominican Republic was Florida's #2 trading (import/export) partner.    But, in that it is the Christmas season and you surely have many gifts to buy, I have decided not to collect on the $5 bet to which you clearly lost.
 
I only wish the TV crews were here to film the outcome.

Governor,

I regret I won't be able to join the other university presidents when
they meet with you on the 17th.  That's graduation day for us, and I
will be hosting Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham, who will be our
commencement speaker.  Chairman Codina will be hosting the Secretary for
dinner at his home that evening.  It's part of our strategy to lay the
groundwork for the major new federal energy center at FIU I discussed
personally with you when we met in Miami.

For your information, I have attached the first two paragraphs of the
proposal's executive summary.

Best regards,

Mitch



EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The events of September 11th and subsequent military action bring the
issue of the Nation's energy security into sharp focus once again.  This
proposal suggests a way to enhance U.S. energy security by building on
the United States' longstanding historical, commercial, social, and
geopolitical ties with Latin America.  Florida International University
(FIU) proposes to create a new kind of academic research, policy
analysis, technology development, and student training institution to
help increase the development of energy supplies and improve energy
efficiency throughout Latin America.

An additional benefit from implementing this proposal would be the
promotion of economic development and political stability throughout the
Western Hemisphere by encouraging clean and affordable development of
indigenous energy resources through investment and technology policya
clear win-win proposition for both the United States and Latin America.

Haiti Migration - needs to be addressed by admin w/creole speaker explaining us policy/where they are etc on miami radio sooner rather than later, also could be a possible precursor of some cuban migration with post hurricane waters and cuba having been hit by sig storm recently
 
Cuban Migration: current situation on the horizon, not on their radar screen as it relates to above scenario, but he agreed w/possiblity and probability of linkage
 
Southcom: He has alerted Frank Miller at NSC, really a DOD decision, we should send same or updated ltr to SecDef Rumsfeld as well and then follow up w/Paul next week....Steve said he had heard no discussion on action on this from Rumsfeld.
 
I have a call into rich armitage, General Powell's deputy re Haiti/Cuba migration and Miami radio....he will call me back after 2:30pm today

Hey, Jeb. It's Truly Burton. I see you are hanging in there with budget
cuts, economic issues, and the like. We are doing the same down here. 

This coming year, BASF's 2002 Program Committee is planning to invite
some dynamic, unique speakers for the Association's General Membership
meetings. We are planning on five major meetings this year with a
variety of highlight speakers. We would very much like for you to be a
featured "highlight" speaker. Since we are planning our calendar now, I
was hoping we could get you to come speak to us, perhaps in either May
or September. We had asked your Scheduler once before (about 12-18
months ago) if you could come talk with us, but that did not work out. 

As we look toward the campaign season, would a debate format/candidates
forum be equally interesting to you? We'd work with your campaign staff
for the right location, moderator(s), questions prepared in advance,
etc.  

Please let us know either way, as the Committee wants to finalize the
2002 calendar and we want to save you the best spot - you are our Number
1 pick! Best of the holiday season to you and your family. Best, Truly.

Dear Governor Bush:

On your watch, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection is now 
proposing a phosphorus rule for the Everglades that will be the gretest 
public policy disaster Florida has faced in 30 years. DEP intends to propose 
a phosphorus standard of 10 ppb based on what it believes would cause no 
changes in the unimpacted (pristine) areas which are 94% of the remaining 
Everglades. The rule would then propose to apply this standard across the 
board to the impacted areas (the remaining 6%) of the Everglades, even 
though neither Florida nor Federal law requires this. While on the surface 
one might read the political tea leaves as indicating public support for 
this stringent Everglades regulation, the misguided DEP proposal promises to 
waste $2-4 billion dollars of taxpayers' money that would likely require tax 
increases during your second administration, potentially devastate an 
important agricultural contributor to Florida's economy and at the same time 
increase mercury contamination in Everglades fish and wildlife to levels 
that further endanger their continued existence. Rumor has it that you have 
reviewed this proposal with DEP and concur with it. We can only assume that 
you have not been fully or fairly briefed on the scientific and economic 
reasons against this proposal. We implore you to give us the opportunity to 
brief you on the economic and environmental consequences of the proposal 
before DEP makes it public at next Tuesday's meeting of the Environmental 
Regulation Commission. I can be reached at (863) 467-9822 over the weekend 
and at my office (561) 996-4701 on Monday.

Respectfully,

George H. Wedgworth

Subject:	Consumer contract scams

Dear Gov. Bush, 

I have become the victim of a scam involving a home alarm service which has an automatic annual renewal clause in the contract.  As a result of this event, it has made me aware that there are probably thousands of Florida residents who have also become victims of similar consumer contracts, so I would like to make a recommendation to provide a remedy to this situation. 

Specifically, I would like to recommend legislation which would require all "automatically" annual renewal invoices to be mailed to consumers BEFORE the renewal date with bold print stating that this contract is the result of an automatic renewal provision in your contract and the consumer has 30 days to notify the business provider if they wish to discontinue the contract. 

In my situation I had signed a contract for 3 years of alarm monitoring service for my residence.  At the end of the 1st and 2nd years I noticed that I received the renewal invoices about 30-60 days after the annual renewal date, but assumed this was an accounting or technology problem with the business, Alarm Depot of Miami, Florida.  After the 3rd yr. of service I again received the invoice about 45 days after the renewal date, so I telephoned the company and instructed them to discontinue the service (the sales rep. had initially told me that a telephone call would be all that was required to cancel the contract even though it states in the contract that this must be done in writing).   

Approximately a month later I received a call from the company in which they told me that I was past due on the invoice so I told them that I had already called and canceled the service.  At this time, I was told by the company rep. that this had to be done in writing and since it wasn't done in writing they could not cancel the service.  On Dec. 6th I received a call from a collection agency in which a very nice lady informed me that I was delinquent and threatened to ruin my credit if I did not pay.  I explained to her that I had canceled, so contacted the company to ask them and called me back to inform me that I had not canceled so they were threatening to sue me as well as place negative remarks on my credit reports. 

I called the company and spoke with Paul who he said I spoke with previously.  He told me that since I had not canceled the contract in writing PRIOR to the renewal date that the full contract amount was due and that he could not accept my cancellation verbally, as I had done attempted to do twice before when speaking with the company.  While he claimed that they have a responsibility to not take verbal cancellations due to someone mistakenly not having security service due to unauthorized cancellation, I counted that argument that this did not make sense due to the fact that the alarm company has passwords which could have been used to verify the authority of the person in which they were speaking. 

After spending a consider amount of time and aggravation on the phone with the company's representatives, I realized that this entire process is a scam to keep people in contracts for longer than they desire.  As a matter of fact, the renewal notice I received this year was also received the same day that I received a delinquency notice for this same invoice.  Furthermore, nowhere on the renewal invoice is there any text notifying customers that this is an "automatically" renewal of the contract, nor any disclosure that cancellation is required in writing BEFORE the renewal date.  Of course it will be impossible to a customer to cancel when renewal invoice is received since the renewal date has already passed. 

In my opinion, what should concern the lawmakers is the fact that this is a relatively small amount of money, i.e., $300, so I am sure that 99% of the customers who are pressed for collection just mail them a check to get collection agents and the company off their backs.  While my situation involves an alarm company, but I suspect that there are other service contracts used in this state that have similar terms which are designed to extract money from customers without their approval.  Hence, my recommendation that this legislation be applied to all consumer contracts in the state, especially for amounts under $500. 

For your investigation the name of this company is Alarm Depot and they are located at 9960 NW 116th Way, Suite 7, Medley, FL 33178 and their telephone number is 305-471-7950. 

Please keep me informed of any investigation results and any proposed legislative changes brought about as a result of this correspondence. 
Sincerely, 
Robert DuKate

P.S.  a more detailed/technical assessment of the situation follows: 
 

Statement of the Problem:

The client was experiencing a problem getting their Blackberry wireless email device to synchronize with Outlook. A generic method (POP3) was used to download email messages from an Exchange server to a laptop. The Blackberry was also used to receive email via wireless. When the Blackberry was placed in the cradle attached to a laptop it would not "synchronize" with Exchange or Outlook on the laptop. In other words, messages that were received, read, deleted, or replied to with the Blackberry were updated on neither the Exchange Server nor Outlook. 

The Analysis:

The Blackberry device will not work with the generic method (POP3) of handling emails. Blackberry requires that its cradle and attached computer have a direct connection to the Exchange Server.  Blackberry synchronizes with the Exchange Server, not Outlook. 

The Solution:

We configured the laptop with an Outlook profile to connect directly to the Exchange Server.  The Blackberry device now works. When the device is put in the cradle it automatically updates the Exchange Server and, by extension, Outlook. We further modified Outlook to use "offline" folders. This provides two major advantages. First, it allows Outlook to be used without an Internet connection. Emails may be managed normally. The next time Outlook is connected to Exchange, it again synchronizes (e.g. sending or deleting emails). The second advantage to this solution is that it requires the least direct communication with Exchange. This is a benefit when operating on a dial-up or low bandwidth line. Using Outlook with offline folders will not significantly degrade performance compared to using Outlook with a POP3 connection. 

In summary, we recommend to Bruce to discontinue using POP3.  Instead, use a direct connection to Exchange with Outlooks offline folders enabled. He is going to implement the solution this afternoon. Their ISP will reconfigure their firewall to enable communication this afternoon. Bruce will also reconfigure their Exchange 2000 Server. Infinity has created a modification for the Exchange Server for Bruce to use.  Infinity will meet with Bruce at 1pm today to assist in the process.

   Just a brief update on the home building business in Florida. As I stated
to you in October at our Fall Conference, the building business is doing
well. I would like to report to you that it has not slowed down in fact it
may be a little better. I have spoken to many builders across the state and
all have reported good traffic and sales. 
   Congratulations on passing the budget cut and on getting the Senate
President and Speaker to work together.  I am sure you are aware that the
Building Code delay passed the House and the Senate. This delay will help
prevent any slow down in our business and hopefully get rid of some of the
confusion that is out there. You stated at our fall conference that you
would support the delay of the code. I would like to thank you  for that
support. If we can implement the bill quickly, I think it will go a long way
toward assuring a more efficient home building process in Florida. If I can
be of help in any way on this issue please call.

Subject:	Call to Senator Lott

BETTY/KATHY, PLS PRINT FOR GOVERNOR AND KATHLEEN.
 
Governor, below is a brief description/update on TANF Supplemental grants and UPL, and suggested talking points for your call to Senator Lott.  Given the latest stand-off on an economic stimulus bill (there are serious concerns that we wont see a bill before Christmas), it really may be more important to call Chairman Young.  Without an economic stimulus package, both UPL and TANF Grants can be added to the Labor-H appropriations bill. 
 
Senator Lott may be reached at 202/224-3135; Chairman Young may be reached at 225-5961.  
 
Background---TANF Supplemental Grants:
 
Senate Finance Committee passed a one year extension of the TANF Supplemental Grants two weeks ago, and have been trying to get it on the Senate calendar.  Republican Leader Trent Lott is the latest Senator to place a hold on the legislation.  He is concerned that the offset is not valid.  We are also working to pass this bill in some form in either the stimulus package, or one of the last appropriations bills before Congress adjourns.  Senator Lott's support (or at the least, no objection) would be important in whatever package may become available.  This one-year extension of TANF supplemental grants will provide an additional $60 million to Florida.
 
Background---Medicaid Upper Payment Limit (UPL):
 
Governor, while you have Senator Lott on the phone, you may also want to raise the Medicaid Upper Payment Limit.  With the recent rule from HHS/CMS reducing the UPL from 150% to 100% sometime in the spring, Florida's $185 million program may be at risk.  There are bills in both the House and Senate that would create a one-year moratorium on HHS/CMS in going forward with the rule until January 2003. 
 
Suggested Talking Points:
*	Mr. Leader, [make small talk about watching proceedingsdifficultjust finished our own session.]  
*	TANF supplemental grants are very important to Florida---and all southern states.
*	These supplemental grants are intended to provide equity for states with historically low welfare payments and high growth. 
*	TANF reserves from prior years have been depleted in Florida, and in other sunbelt states. 
*	Everyday Florida has new TANF applicants due to our economic slowdown----putting new strains on our programs. 
*	Without these grants, Florida's ability to provide critical TANF work supports will suffer.
*	These are not welfare payments.  The grants serve to help with transportation and child care services, so that citizens can go to work.
UPL
*	We also need help with Florida's UPL plan.
*	These dollars are directed to hospitals serving low-income and uninsured populations 
*	The program was designed to provide financial stability to our safety-net hospitals 
*	CONCLUSION:  In this soft economy, I would appreciate any thing you can do to help with a UPL soft landing until January of 2003, and I would appreciate your help in getting a one-year extension of TANF supplemental grants passed before Congress recesses.

Inside the Pentagon reported that an announcement on the creation of a Homeland Defense Command is imminent in the "next few weeks." Many in the Army reportedly favor identifying Joint Forces Command as the homeland security lead, whereas the other Services on the whole prefer the creation of an entirely new command organization to handle that mission.

The Joint Staff's Directorate for Strategic Plans and Policy (J-5) has led a working group of O-6 level officers for several weeks to flesh out options for tasking the homeland security mission.

If a new organization is created, other elements of the unified combatant command structure may be cut, according to Inside the Pentagon, and one potential candidate for trimming or elimination is said to be Southern Command.

Subject:	The "Newer Kinder" Medicare (CMS)

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am writing this letter to comment on the "newer, kinder" Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.  I certainly have not found them to be any less frustrating than usual.
 
Have you looked at the Provider Application process lately?  We I have!  I am in process of completing an application for a physician who will be joining our group soon.  When I signed onto the CMA website to print the application, I was overwhelmed, to say the least, to find that one section of the application was 57 pages long, one section was 67 pages long, one section was 31 pages long and just the reassignment of benefits form was 9 pages long.  Maybe you would not be intimated by the sheer volume of these applications but a simple working person out here in the trenches is.  It was my understanding that the new applications, effective November, 2001, were simpler, clearer and easier. But looking at these I sure don't feel that they are simpler, clearer and easier.  
 
I did receive The Florida Medicare B Update on Saturday, December 1 which included information regarding a "FREE" Provider Enrollment Workshop to be held in Jacksonville, FL on December 13 or 14th.  It stated that we should "Register Early, because "Seating is limited."  However, there was no phone number, fax number etc to facilitate that happening.  When I finally did get a phone number for Provider Education (not an 800# by the way) 904-791-6422 and I began calling on Monday, Dec. 3 to register I was instructed to leave a detailed message.  I did this including my phone number, fax number, and e-mail address where I could be reached.  I noted that I needed confirmation that I would be able to attend so that I could make travel and motel arrangements as I am approx 6-7 hours away.  I have now made 26 long distance phone calls as well as spending my time which is very valuable to me. By the time I incur travel/hotel costs along with the time and phone calls, this certainly will not have been "FREE" to me.  By Monday, if I were to get a response by then, I will have only 2 days left to make arrangements to attend. 
 
Let me stress, it is very important to me to attend this workshop!!   Having been through the application process several times previously with disastrous results I was so excited to think that I might get my "questions answered directly by a Medicare Expert" who will give me "on-the-spot" assistance in completing and submitting my enrollment applications.  
 
I have always supported you and felt that you were supportive of the people in this state and the medical community.  I will certainly appreciate it if you can offer any assistance to a small rural town physician's office in your state.

Subject:	RE: STO and Bobby 

Governor,
 
The TimeDirect system was originally developed in 1999 and the program has been significantly enhanced since that time to respond to needs and comments of our customers.  These enhancements include increased accessibility for the system.  Some previous accessiblity issues with the system were quickly resolved with an upgrade to the user's accessibility tool.  The STO works closely with Julie Shaw and the ADA Working Group to solve issues such as these, and, in checking with Julie on this issue, she is not aware of any unresolved accessibility issues with TimeDirect.  The email does not specifically mention any accessibility problem but rather stresses the importance of testing the system with the Bobby Program.  I will check on whether a new issue has arisen.  However, the STO does not set its accessibility standard relative to results from the Bobby Program.  The Bobby Program is not a true measure of accessibility and is generally seen as an introduction to the issue.  Many Web sites may pass a Bobby review and yet remain inaccessible.   Again, we work closely with Julie and others on this issue, and they do not recommend the Bobby approach.  For Web site accessibility, our standard is Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act -  the current and significantly more comprehensive federal standard.
 
I understand the Department of Health issue has been ongoing since November 2000.  Julie Shaw was made aware of the situation in October of this year and brought it to the attention of the STO last month.  I understand a work analysis evaluation has been performed by the Division of Blind Services, the solution is now a top priority within DOH, and the problem will be fixed in two to three months.  I am also working with the CIOs to insert a "web accessibility" component into our statewide applications procurement and development processes.  I will continue to monitor this issue. 
 
If you would like to discuss further, please let me know.

Subject: STO and Bobby 



Dear Governor Bush: 

Thank you for forwarding my e-mail to the appropriate persons who handle the 
Times Direct system.  I have spoken with Donna Livingston at DMS about the 
issue and hopefully they will test the system with the Bobby program to make 
it more accessible.  It may not cost a lot of money either since many of the 
changes that the Bobby Program includes are simple.  I strongly encouraged 
her to work on this problem since the state does not want to be put in a 
position of looking as though it does not care if it complies with federal 
laws.  The ADA is not a voluntary law.  I don't think the state can argue 
hardship either because it knew before the system was purchased that the 
Bobby program should be included and used to make it accessible. I don't 
know why the STO did not check this before they bought the program.  

I have a friend who works for the Department of Health and she is having the 
same problem with their statewide program used for case management.  The 
department of Health was told before they ever purchased this case 
management program that it was not accessible to the disabled however, they 
purchased it anyway. Since that department receives federal money they are 
in an awkward position because they could be sued under several different 
laws including the OFCCP and probably the DOJ. Ninety per cent of her job is 
computer work and since they have installed this new program she is unable 
to do her job because the entire program is icon based and totally 
inaccessible to blind persons who use speech programs.  It also uses a blue 
screen which makes Braille displays unusable and prevents her from using an 
Optacon which is an old device that people used to use to read displays 
before speech programs were created.  This lady, Ms. Elizabeth Bowden,  has 
worked with the Vocational Rehabilitation program for ten years and now 
because of this badly designed Department of Health Case Management system, 
she will probably have to be moved to another position through no fault of 
her own and will have to move from the job that she does very well.  She is 
a VR Technician and has handled the job well until now. By the way, the 
Comptroller's office program for Employee Earnings Statement review works 
very well and is totally accessible.   

I am letting you know these things, because  the STO is falling down on the 
job in making the state's computer systems more efficient and user friendly. 
Some of the staff  also have the attitude that its just not important and 
we've never had a blind employee before so we just didn't know.   I think it 
is very important especially when the state may be subject to being sued 
when that is not necessary if precautions  are taken. Also,not having had to 
deal with disabled employees before is not an excuse especially when there 
are programs like Bobby available to assist in making programs compliant. 

Sincerely, 

Linda Mathis

MEMORANDUM

To:		Chief Stephen Lauer
From:		General Counsel Michael Ramage
Subject:	Terrorism Proposals Enacted By Special Session
	


As you know, this morning the Florida House Of Representatives passed
several terrorism-related bills.   The proposals have now passed the
Legislature (having passed the Senate on Monday) and move to Governor Bush
for signing.  He will sign them promptly, and we expect there will be formal
bill-signing event since these proposals are of major significance.  The
proposals become effective "upon becoming law" when Governor Bush signs
them. 

Here is a brief summary of each bill that passed.  Included is a link to the
Legislature's web site where the bill as passed can be reviewed.  Each bill,
including legislative staff analyses and vote histories, as well as the
"enrolled" (final, as will go into law books) version, can be located at the
Legislature's web site: www.leg.state.fl.us under "Senate" chamber and the
2001-C Session.  (Note:  When accessing the site, it defaults to the 2002
Session.  You have to manually change to the 2001-C Session.  Make sure the
"Senate" is selected as the chamber.)  If there is any question about the
impact or purpose of any proposal noted below, feel free to call me at (850)
410-7676 or email me at: michaelramage@fdle.state.fl.us

Dear Mr. Bush, 

   I remember coming to you with a plea for help.  I remember how stern and 
serious you took the meeting.  I remember you assigning someone to take care 
of the matter.  Well, here we are, nothing's changed other than DCF trying 
to cover its ass.  Let me give you a quick idea as to what I've lost during 
this ordeal: my truck, my job, my dignity, and my freedom.  I can't do this 
anymore.  Your agencies have blantently and provably broken the law, 
violated my rights & civil liberties, harbored an abusive individual and 
lied to cover it up in a swamp of paper work, broken promises and mis 
represented statements.  When the inspector general showed up at my house, 
his only concern was finding a fall guy in the matter; Delisa Mathews will 
be the target I'm sure.  When they dealt with Nancy and Al, it was purely a 
"prove DCF didn't relatiate" routine.  Now, when I talk to Sue Grey & 
BaryBeth on the matter, it's "we don't know anything" or "we can't tell you 
anything".  Well, tell me this Jeb, how is it that I've commited NO CRIME, 
I've done EVERYTHING that DCF has told me and I'm STILL paying for this??? 
No more.  I've waited long enough and sacrificed everything I can.  Is this 
the type of organization that runs the state I live in?  Well, it seems that 
my hands were bound 8 years ago when I was raped & they're still bound 
today.  I'm turning Charlie over to DCF as it's clear that I have no help in 
this matter and DCF has a state budget.  Personally, I hope you feel a 
little better knowing that an 8 year child can't be protected in your state 
because you don't have a clue as to what goes on behind your back.  As for 
me, I'll spend the next 5 or so years trying to recover what has taken me a 
lifetime to aquire and as for Charlie, all I can do is hope he makes it. 

Thanks for your help, 
John Greiner 

If you can't/won't help me, at least prevent this from happening to other 
innocent people.

SOUTHCOM
We are producing a letter now for Gov to send to Rumsfeld.  In my discussion with Asst Sec of Defense, Ray Dubois this morning, he noted that he had not seen (nor heard) about letter sent by Gov to Wolfowitz.   He wanted a faxed copy if possible.   He did say though that Barry McCaffrey has been vocal and adament about keeping SOUTHCOM in Miami.  Dubois said McCaffrey has very compelling arguments.  Congressman Hobson is adamently against it being in Miami (biggest hurdle politically).  FYI, McCaffrey was a former commander of SOUTHCOM.  Also, Chuck Ohlinger was the commander at MacDill when deliberations and decisions were made to put SOUTHCOM, Central Command (CENTCOM), and Special Ops Command (SOCOM) all in Florida.  Charlie said he would be more than willing to help in providing rationale as to why SOUTHCOM needs to remain here.
 
I spoke to Mike Rhodes, SOUTHCOM, today who said that Secretary Rumsfeld has apparently called for a list of potential names of folks to command SOUTHCOM.  Depending how you read it, this may signify that the Secretary is considering keeping SOUTHCOM mission as a regional command (and not subordinating it under homeland defense).
 
HOMESTEAD
The Secretary of Air Force, James Roche is sending a letter out (today?) to advise that the investigation is completed and there are "no deviations" so they are not going to overturn the supplmental ROD.  Also, yesterday, Miami-Dade voted 8 -5 in favor of eco-tourism use. 
 
KEY WEST
Dubois wanted to make sure we were aware and okay with Navy decision to not move forward with transfer of land from Navy to the City due to post 9/11 land needs.  I told him we were aware, and that I had been engaged with local and state leadership to ensure minimal feathers ruffled.
 
VISIT TO TAMPA
Ray Dubois also wanted us to know that he will be in Tampa on Sunday and Monday to speak before a global Special Ops Medical conference.  On Monday, he will also meet with General Tommy Franks and General Holland (SOCOM/CENTCOM).

	Subject:  New Building Codes 


Dear Mr. Governor;

	I have had the opportunity to be involved in many Hurricane recoveries and
cleanup from Camille 1969-70 to Georges 1998-1999. As a practicing Engineer in
public service for more than 35 years, I ask that you do what is required to
NOT delay the implementations of the Florida Unified Building Code. The people
of Florida should not be ask to adsorb the cost replacing the large number of
building being built that will not survive the storms that visit us our
state.

	Delaying the new code is akin to not adding oil to your car when the low oil
indicator is showing. The cost of the probable damage will far out weigh cost
of a quart of oil. 

	The citizens of Florida need you to stand tall and firm in their corner as a
voice of reason as others over react to events of the last few months.


	Thank you for your time and attention.

Governor,

I regret I won't be able to join the other university presidents when
they meet with you on the 17th.  That's graduation day for us, and I
will be hosting Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham, who will be our
commencement speaker.  Chairman Codina will be hosting the Secretary for
dinner at his home that evening.  It's part of our strategy to lay the
groundwork for the major new federal energy center at FIU I discussed
personally with you when we met in Miami.

For your information, I have attached the first two paragraphs of the
proposal's executive summary.

Best regards,

Mitch



EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The events of September 11th and subsequent military action bring the
issue of the Nation's energy security into sharp focus once again.  This
proposal suggests a way to enhance U.S. energy security by building on
the United States' longstanding historical, commercial, social, and
geopolitical ties with Latin America.  Florida International University
(FIU) proposes to create a new kind of academic research, policy
analysis, technology development, and student training institution to
help increase the development of energy supplies and improve energy
efficiency throughout Latin America.

An additional benefit from implementing this proposal would be the
promotion of economic development and political stability throughout the
Western Hemisphere by encouraging clean and affordable development of
indigenous energy resources through investment and technology policya
clear win-win proposition for both the United States and Latin America.

Subject:	Everglades Phosphorus Rule

Dear Governor Bush:  I am one of your governing board appointees to the
South Florida Water Management District.  I would like to provide you with
some throughts for the Everglades Phosphorus Rule that will be forthcoming
soon.  Earlier this week, Henry Dean and I met with four representatives of
the sugar industry regarding this issue.  Their concerns are very much along
the same lines as mine.  First, I believe that the phosphorus standard is 10
parts per billion phosphorus.  Research strongly supports this.  This in
itself is not an issue.   Second, where the standard is met is an issue.
Meeting it at the end of pipe will be an impossibility.  There is no
technology that we can use today that will get us there except for chemical
treatment no one wants to use it because of possible marsh effects and
disposal problems with the waste stream.  The STAs can get us to the range
of 20-30 ppb.  To set a standard of 10 ppb at end of pipe will automatically
put us in violation of the rule. A possible solution is to meet the standard
in the marsh.  Or possibly to give us more time perhaps another five years
to attempt to find a cost effective means of reaching the standard.   Third,
if there was an application of a technology such as chemical treatment that
could get us to 10 ppb phosphorus, it would probably cost about $1billion to
$2 billion to achieve it.  Inasmuch as we are having funding problems
everywhere (Everglades, Lake Okeechobee, alternative water supplies, land
acquisition, etc) this is too great a burden.  

I would like to ask for your consideration in asking the Department of
Environmental Protection to not come up with a phosphorus rule that will
automatically put us in default of the rule and in severe debt and without a
technology that is acceptable.  

Thank you governor for your consideration of these ideas.

Honorable Jeb Bush
Governor, State of Florida
Executive Office of the Governor

Tallahassee, Florida 32399

RE:	Haulover Park, Northern Miami-Dade County

Dear Governor,

   I applaud the Department of Environmental
protections recent order denying a permit for a
Gambling Boat to be located at Haulover Park, a public
park located in northern Miami-Dade County. 

   It has become increasingly evident that the Parks
Department, along with lobbyists and some publicly
elected officials intend to use the Park to line their
pockets rather than provide quality recreational
entertainment for the public.  In addition to failing
to follow their mandate to protect rather than harm
the natural environment, the Parks Departments
redevelopment plan uses tax dollars to pay for
improvements that will benefit commercial enterprises
rather than the public at large.

   I participated in a Labor Day Awareness Session at
Haulover.  I spoke with hundreds of people that day
who were there to enjoy the park.  Overwhelmingly,
these people were frustrated that a gambling boat was
running out of the park and taking up parking spaces
for families.  They disliked the fact that parking for
the gambling boat was free, while the amount of 
parking for park users was reduced and cost $4.00. 
More importantly, people were upset that this was how
the Parks department was using its time and energy. 
They expressed a desire for more trees (shade) in the
park, and more playgrounds for their children.  Many
families are moving into areas that were previously
largely retirement communities near the Park.  They
would like a place to take their children to play, not
a place to go gambling.  The park stands greatly
neglected, yet the slated improvements do not include
refurbishing public benches and restrooms for years. 
Instead, the Parks department is paving the way for
commercial enterprises to operate out of the park.  I
will send you some of the comment cards people filled
out on Labor Day under separate cover so you can see
for yourself that the Parks Department plans do not
reflect the will of park users.

   I appreciate your Departments decision to block
gambling in this beautiful park near my home, and hope
that you will continue with your good work to ensure
this public treasure will be enjoyed by generations to
come for what it was intended to be: a public park.

Sincerely,

Subject:	Presidential salaries

You have probably seen the attached article, but I want to flag it for you
because it has VERY significant negative implications.  Before I left the
Chancellor's office we hired a consultant who specializes in reviewing
presidential salaries.  The current salary structure for presidents reflects
the results of that survey.  You should know that there are no states in
America in which the president of a second level research institution earns
a higher salary than those in the major research institutions.  In this
case, Mitch will not only make more than the presidents of UF, FSU and USF,
but more than that of many of the presidents of most of the American
Association of Universities presidents (the major research institutions in
America).  In addition to the $285,000 salary, he also will receive another
12% of that amount from the foundation. This brings the total cash
compensation package to:  $319,200, along with a car and free housing.  

This action will put pressure on all the other Boards of Trustees to
increase salaries of their presidents so that the current salary balance
related to mission is returned.  When the faculty around the state hear
about this over the next few days, it will cause those with salaries above
$90,000 to  ignore your request to reject salary increases.  The argument
will be that if the Boards of Trustees can ignore your request in
establishing presidential salaries, why should they comply with your
request.  This action could not have come at a worse time for the
universities.  It sends a message that is totally inconsistent with your
expressed desires for sacrifice.  Moreover, any responsible consultant
analyzing presidential salaries could not have made such a recommendation
based on all the data I saw over the last four years as Chancellor.  

A critical policy question here is whether local boards sould have the final
decision authority on compensation issues without review and approval either
by the Secretary of Education or the State Board.  As these decisions have
such significant implications for the entire university system, such a
review is essential if you want to maintain a rational presidential salary
strucuture for the state.

If you would like any other observations or information, please let me know.

Taxpayers Foot Bill on Wingate Landfill
But Cleanup Still Lags, Activist Says
 
       Residents have paid for cleanup of the Wingate Road Municipal Incinerator and Landfill Superfund Site for more than 20 years but have seen no results, according to one citizen.
 
       Denise Cobb, president of Second Chance Inc., a nonprofit organization that follows federal funding for the Fort Lauderdale community, said she found out that the Fort Lauderdale government has billed the community for cleanup of the landfill. People are getting angry and want the city to use that money to clean the landfill, she told HWSW. 
 
       The remedy for the landfill is a cap, according to government officials. When the city says cap it is misleading because it sounds secure, but what the city is doing is putting a plastic and soil layer over the landfill, she said.
 
Find Alternatives, Citizens Say
 
       The community wants the landfill remediated using other alternatives besides the cap, Legal Aid of Broward County Inc. lawyer Sharon Bourassa said. But the state wants to keep the plastic liner, "the horse and buggy of our time," instead of using newer technology, she told HWSW. Bourassa represents a group of mostly black residents of public housing projects adjacent to the dump in an environmental justice case. She recently filed appellant briefs on behalf of the residents. The court will review the case Dec. 20, she said.
 
       Citing higher-than-expected levels of pollutants, the residents said they want to move. The case was dismissed by a federal judge in August (HWSW, Sept. 10, p. 355) and now is being appealed to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. 
 
       "Our argument is that it is fine and dandy to restrict potentially responsible parties from litigating during remediation activities, but you cannot restrict citizens from doing so," Bourassa said. 
 
       In addition, not allowing the citizens' concerns to be heard discriminates against minorities because they are usually the ones living around these contaminated sites, Bourassa said. 
 
       "What is driving this whole thing is money and politics, and it's an absolute shame," Cobb said.
 
       The residents also are worried, that, with the war going on, if an explosive was dropped on Wingate the contamination would go everywhere, Bourassa said.
 
       The city plans to build a nine-hole golf course at the site once the cap is finished. When people start trampling and walking on the contamination the movement is going to push the contamination into the ground water, Cobb told HWSW. 
       
       Children will be playing on the golf course and they should not, Bourassa said. The liner may leak. Contacts: Sharon Bourassa, Legal Aid, (954) 765-8950; Denise Cobb, Second Chance Inc., pager: (954) 705-0454.

P.S.  a more detailed/technical assessment of the situation follows: 
 

Statement of the Problem:

The client was experiencing a problem getting their Blackberry wireless email device to synchronize with Outlook. A generic method (POP3) was used to download email messages from an Exchange server to a laptop. The Blackberry was also used to receive email via wireless. When the Blackberry was placed in the cradle attached to a laptop it would not "synchronize" with Exchange or Outlook on the laptop. In other words, messages that were received, read, deleted, or replied to with the Blackberry were updated on neither the Exchange Server nor Outlook. 

The Analysis:

The Blackberry device will not work with the generic method (POP3) of handling emails. Blackberry requires that its cradle and attached computer have a direct connection to the Exchange Server.  Blackberry synchronizes with the Exchange Server, not Outlook. 

The Solution:

We configured the laptop with an Outlook profile to connect directly to the Exchange Server.  The Blackberry device now works. When the device is put in the cradle it automatically updates the Exchange Server and, by extension, Outlook. We further modified Outlook to use "offline" folders. This provides two major advantages. First, it allows Outlook to be used without an Internet connection. Emails may be managed normally. The next time Outlook is connected to Exchange, it again synchronizes (e.g. sending or deleting emails). The second advantage to this solution is that it requires the least direct communication with Exchange. This is a benefit when operating on a dial-up or low bandwidth line. Using Outlook with offline folders will not significantly degrade performance compared to using Outlook with a POP3 connection. 

In summary, we recommend to Bruce to discontinue using POP3.  Instead, use a direct connection to Exchange with Outlooks offline folders enabled. He is going to implement the solution this afternoon. Their ISP will reconfigure their firewall to enable communication this afternoon. Bruce will also reconfigure their Exchange 2000 Server. Infinity has created a modification for the Exchange Server for Bruce to use.  Infinity will meet with Bruce at 1pm today to assist in the process.

   Just a brief update on the home building business in Florida. As I stated
to you in October at our Fall Conference, the building business is doing
well. I would like to report to you that it has not slowed down in fact it
may be a little better. I have spoken to many builders across the state and
all have reported good traffic and sales. 
   Congratulations on passing the budget cut and on getting the Senate
President and Speaker to work together.  I am sure you are aware that the
Building Code delay passed the House and the Senate. This delay will help
prevent any slow down in our business and hopefully get rid of some of the
confusion that is out there. You stated at our fall conference that you
would support the delay of the code. I would like to thank you  for that
support. If we can implement the bill quickly, I think it will go a long way
toward assuring a more efficient home building process in Florida. If I can
be of help in any way on this issue please call.

Dear Jeb, 

        We spoke last April about the possibility of your attending the inaugural opening of the Naples Botanical Gardens on Saturday evening, February 13, 2002 in Naples. Since it was far too early for you to commit, you asked me to contact you as we got closer to the event. I spoke to Mr. Jimison today, and he is going to put the date in the computer, but he explained to me that your schedule really remains open and flexible until six weeks prior.

        He also suggested that I e-mail you to remind you about the event, so you could contact him about scheduling it into your calendar if you are interested. Naples and the surrounding area is a very affluent region. The property for the Botanical Gardens (150 acres worth $5 million) was donated by a single Naples resident. The additional money (millions of dollars) has also been donated by the residents of Naples.

        Mr. Jimison suggested that a fundraiser held by the Party, scheduled during that time frame, might make your stop in Naples more persuasive. I have therefore contacted Mike Hanna, and am faxing a copy of this e-mail. As further incentive, my husband and I would be honored to have you stay with us in our Naples home. We live on the golf course, so perhaps you could relax for a few hours, get in a round of golf on a beautiful course and/or do a little fishing. Our next-door neighbor is the president of the Gardens, so you would also have the opportunity to meet her.

        Jeb, your appearance at the event would mean so much to the Gardens and to the people of Naples -- and, of course, I always enjoy speaking with you. Please try to come.

        I look forward to hearing from you.

Dear Mary, 

      My name is Phyllis Bridges and I am a member of the District 7 Family Care Council and know Beatrice Schindler also.  In fact, several members of the Family Care Council have been writing in support of her getting an A.B.L.E. Center in Osceola County.  However, now Beatrice, you and the rest of us are becoming very suspicious of this so-call "foundation."  I have emailed some of Beatrice's correspondence, as well as your very intelligent letter to Lori Bennett of A.B.L.E., along with her reply to Beatrice's letter declining involvement with A.B.L.E., to our District 7 Developmental Disabilities Administrator, Bob Morin, and his Program Manager, Cheryl Mundy, asking them to possibly investigate this organization and warn the public if necessary. 

      We commend you on your efforts for your county and hope that if this is indeed a scam, that they are exposed promptly and that the public, especially vulnerable parents of our DD population, be made aware. 

      Thanks for you advocacy and service to the DD population and families of Volusia County.

See news report below.  I spoke with Meeks COS.  Apparently its shingles.  Shes still in the hospital but may be out by noon today. A call would be nice----Hospital:  301/295-9302;  home, 202/544-3190.
 
WASHINGTON  Florida Rep. Carrie Meek was hospitalized Thursday after experiencing severe abdominal pains. 
Meek, a five-term Democrat who represents the Miami area, was admitted to Bethesda Naval Hospital, said deputy chief of staff John Shelby. 
Shelby said Meek, 75, began experiencing pain the day before. 
"She went and saw the doctor a couple of times. They were not able to diagnose what was wrong and they were not able to alleviate the pain," Shelby said. "They will be doing tests to find out what's wrong with her." 
Meek was unable to be present for Thursday's vote on whether to grant the president the authority to negotiate trade deals. That measure passed by only one vote. 
Meek's son, Florida state Sen. Kendrick B. Meek, was en route to Washington to be with his mother, Shelby said.

Hi - Hope you guys are well.  As much as I hate to bother you with my
mundane client business, one of our clients has asked me to seek your
assistance on something that could actually benefit Florida.

Don't know whether or not this might have come up yesterday but Mark Foley
has introduced a bill (attached) that will provide relief to states whose
tourism revenue has suffered due to 9/11.  Specifically, this bill would
direct the Secretary of Commerce to provide grants to state agencies for
advertising to promote travel and tourism. Vivendi/Universal thinks this is
a good idea and would love for the Governor to do a letter in support of the
bill to the Congressional leadership in the House and Senate.  We would be
happy to draft a letter for your review.

Thanks in advance for your consideration.

Regards,
Kimberley

Dear Jeb.....
It is my understanding that the mail order pilot program for diabetes for patients along the I-4 corridor (Central Florida) requires that patients receive their diabetic medications and supplies through an out of state provider Health Alliance.  Not only is that an outrage for businesses within this state but that it makes no sense at all medically.- it is dangerous to the patient.  Our pharmacy presently provides medication management for the Senior Resource Alliance which includes 5 counties in Central Florida.  We monitor not only their diabetes but also the diseases which are a direct result on non-compliance,  inappropriate use of medication, failure to properly educate, etc.  And- it is at no charge to anyone including the Medicaid program. There is no way to control the health of these people with the therapy bifurcated and with incomplete patient history at our pharmacy.   It is inconceivable that you would allow this to go to a company which up to this point has not performed in a satisfactory matter when you have a woman owned business in this state (and a staunch Republican member of the Republican Congressional Committee Business Advisory Council) right here in Central Florida (Orlando).  I understand that you will be in Orlando tomorrow and I would hope that you would have a few moments to speak with me as I have been invited by Rich Crotty to attend-as a member of OCREC.  Please e-mail me concerning this.  Thank you.

NEXT...S0216....ONLY HOSPITAL NURSES ARE MENTIONED....THIS IS NOT RIGHT....THE LAW UPPED THE ANTE IN LTC ALSO,,,THE INDUSTRY SHOULD ALSO BE MENTIONED.  THERE SHOULD BE AN AMENDMENT HITTING THE TEMPORARY AGENCIES THAT ARE BASICALLY PERMITTING POOR QUALITY, FAST MONEY AND OUTRAGEOUS RATE GAUGING TO PREVAIL...THIS IS WRONG.  WITHOUT MONITORING AND REGS., THEY ARE HURTING THE PROFESSION IN THE STATE (NURSING, I MEAN).  THEY ARE COSTING THE HOSPITALS, LTC AND HOME HEALTH UNBELIEVABLE $$$'S WITH NO BACKUP OF QUALITY.  MOST LARGE LTC COMPANIES ARE NOT ALLOWING THEIR BLDGS. TO USE, THUS STRAINING THEIR EXISTING STAFF AND RUNNING CARE ON A SHOE STRING, RESULTING IN POORER CARE.  THIS I KNOW IS TRUE. 

LAST QUERY.....PANEL ON PROBABLE CAUSE...AHCA BASED......THIS IS OUT OF SUNSHINE?  A PROFESSIONAL CAN BE ACCUSED BY UNKNOWNS, FOR CAUSES KNOWN ONLY TO THIS PANEL, WITH NO CHANCE TO REVIEW UNTIL AFTER CHARGES BY DOH ARE BROUGHT?

Dear Governor Bush: 


We are writing to you in keeping with a discussion that we had in your 
office last year.  We had met with you regarding the process of implementing 
community-based care, and you had requested at that time that we let you 
know of issues that needed to be addressed to keep the implementation on 
track. 

An extremely important issue has come to our attention as we move forward 
with implementing comunity-based care projects in additional communities 
(Daytona Beach, Tampa, Pensacola and Palm Beach).  Private providers are 
currently being required to secure a performance bond equal to 25% of the 
community-based care contracts.  There are a number of detrimental impacts 
of this requrement.  They include: 

        1.  The costs of securing the bond.   The lead agencies are being 
asked to secure and pay for the bonds.  The cost of the bonds is 
approximately $15 per $1,000 of coverage, which would create $1.5 million of 
costs being diverted from service provision (based on $400 million) of CBC 
contracts. 

        2.  Many CBC systems are being developed using separately 
incorporated entities.  They are unable to secure the performance bonds and 
the bonds are only attainable when a third party provides a guarantee for 
the bond.  The bonding companies are requiring guarantees from 
community-based agencies against their limited assets. 

        3.  With agency assets pledged against the bonds we are concerned 
about the mpact on our ability to continue to raise funds privately if a 
donor feels that their contribution could be lost. 

While we understand the state's need for some form of protection against the 
default of the CBC initiative, the current requirements will dramatically 
limit the ability of community-based agencies to assume the lead agency 
role.  Strong participation of experienced community-based agencies is 
essential to successfully complete the vision of community-based care. 

We would be happy to meet with you or a member of your staff to discuss this 
issue further. 

Thank you very much for your attention to this matter.

Good morning Governor Bush,
  Hope everything is fine for you today.  Well we were told by the District 1 Developmental Disabilities office that all the special projects for districts 1,2,and 4 will cease as of Dec. 10th this year.  This is a sad, sad time for the Great State of Florida, and for families with handicapped children and adult children.  I am afraid that our state institutions for the handicapped will soon be crowded beyond belief because some parents will have no choice with their supports removed but to remand their handicapped children over to DCF facilities.  We were also told that all cost plans for individuals will be cut by $150.00.  for some individuals that is their whole cost plan, and that cuts in cost plans will be even higher is some other districts.  That all personal care attendants will be cut, another reason DCF's will become crowded.
I know these are hard times, and everyone need to bite the bullet so to say but to ruin the lives of individuals with handicaps and their families, it's just a very hard pill to swallow.
Sir is there anything I can do to help as an individual and in my capacity as chairman of the Family Care Council in District 1?
I would be more than willing to help any anyway. I have been ask to speak at the CAFE this year that is if we have one, and was wondering what would be a good subject to speak on that can be encouraging to our families during this time.  Thanks for listening to me again sir and please have a nice day.  Your friend, Darrell Walker

Pamella:

Here is a telephone number that Governor Bush can use in Seoul, Korea to
reach Chairman Chung, Mong-koo, head of Hyundai and Kia Motors Co.  # 011
822-3464-1004.  Please remember that Korea is 14 hours ahead of Florida
time. I would suggest that Jeb place a call between 7:00PM and 9:00PM.  He
hopefully will be able to reach the Chairman during this time or quickly
receive a return call.  Of course, this is your decision.

FYI, I understand that the Survey and Arrangement Committee of Hyundai on
site selection has already reported to the Chairman that they do not feel
that Florida is a favorable location for this new factory.  Frankly, their
opinion of Florida is that we are a state of retirees sunning on the beach
and that we do not have a sufficient labor force.
I am confident that Jeb can disprove this misconception when he reaches
Chairman Chung.  

I'll cross my fingers and await your call..

Exerting no influence
Peter Wallsten's Dec. 2 column, Senate soap opera: Lust for power suggests
that I am influencing the race for the next president of the Florida Senate.
This is false, irresponsible and unfair -- not only to me but to each of the
candidates currently vying for the post.
Far from directing my supposed ``emissaries'' to make ``suggestions'' to
unnamed parties, I publicly have refused to endorse any candidate and have
remained true to that position in private. It is outrageous to suggest that
I am offering the quid pro quo of job opportunities for supporting one
candidate over others.

Lt. Gov. Frank Brogan told Senate President John McKay last week on the
Senate floor that neither he nor I wish to influence the internal
deliberations of that chamber regarding its future leadership. I remain
ready and willing to work with any senator designated to lead colleagues in
the future. Any suggestion to the contrary is false.

To Chairman Ryu, via Mr. Lee, Secretary:

I am so sorry that my last e-mail was not received by you.  I checked and
found out that I sent it to an incorrect address ( sslee33@hanmail.com)  My
terrible mistake.  Unfortunately, my mistake has delayed proper
communication for several days.  Now the problem is finally resolved.

First, I must tell you that the Governor of Florida, the Honorable Jeb Bush,
is very anxious to contact with Chairman Chung to introduce the wonderful
State of Florida and to demonstrate to the Chairman how much we believe that
Florida should be allowed to apply for consideration for location of the new
Hyundai factory in the USA.  
I have had meetings with Dr. Pamella Dana, Director of Economic Development
for Gov. Bush.  Dr. Dana has informed the Gov. of our meetings and he is
counting on me to provide him with a direct number where he can communicate
and commence a dialogue with Chairman Chung.  We, in Florida, know of the
keen competition and honestly feel that Florida can match up and/or surpass
the other states currently under consideration.
Once again, I am very sorry that after my first 
e-mail reached you correctly, I made an error that caused you and I several
days of unnecessary delay.
Please respond, ASAP, I await your instructions for this telephone call.

As always, I remain your sincere friend,

Governor Bush,
   I wanted to take a moment to thank you for your efforts to increase
tourism to Florida in general and Walt Disney World in particular. I'm a
Disney stockholder and fan, so I benefit doubly when the company
thrives! I've also appreciated President Bush's comments encouraging
people to come visit. I believe Michael Eisner was down here in the same
timeframe as your visit, so you undoubtedly had the chance to speak with
him. Attendance in Disney's theme parks have been steadily picking up,
according to some friends I have who work there. I'm told that over the
Thanksgiving weekend, attendance at most of the parks was on par with
(or at least close to) last year's levels. The biggest problem is that
the occupancy rates at Disney's resorts--and the others in Orlando--are
so low. Still, at least we can see a light at the end of the tunnel.
   I also wanted to thank you for your leadership in helping us clear up
our concerns with the State Technology Office. While the issues haven't
yet been completely resolved (although I'm afraid STO may think they
have), the lines of communication have at least been opened. Dialog an
self-evaluation seem to be taking place, and that's a good thing. I'm
optimistic that the problems will be resolved once FIRN and STO can talk
a bit more.
   You might also be interested to know that I signed up through your
Web site to help the reelection campaign. I'm a long-time Republican; in
fact, I was the Treasurer of the Taylor County Young Republicans for
some time and have worked with Daryll Gunther quite a bit.
   Which leads me to my last point. THANK YOU for appointing Daryll as a
County Commissioner following the untimely death of Bea Foskey. I don't
know if Daryll has shared with you the sheer idiocy that tends to
surround our Commissioners and their actions. It's like a T.V. sitcom,
and would be comical if these goons weren't actually affecting the lives
of real people. Daryll is a breath of fresh air, and a voice of reason
on a ship of fools. He's not afraid to call a spade a spade, and I
appreciate it. He was an excellent choice, and has done an outstanding
job.

Dear Governor Bush, 

I cannot truly express how much I appreciate your continued support of our 
Nurse Practitioner Prescribing Bill. I'm sure you know by now that we were 
smashed in the House Regulation Committee on Tuesday morning.  We  do not 
consider this as defeat but rather as another hurdle that will be overcome 
while you are still our Governor. The nurses, supportive physicians, and 
Representative Green thank you for having Mike Hansen appear before the 
committee to express your support. We really felt that we would have a 
closer vote but the opposition mounted over the weekend and on Monday was 
widespread and impressive if not always completely accurate. However we are 
hearing from legislators who watched to meeting in their offices that at 
least some are beginning to see that the negative debate at times is a 
message that conveys a lack of respect for the professionalism and ethics of 
registered nurses. 

I did speak with Greg Turberville yesterday and he tells me that he has 
mentioned to FMA that they must meet with our Association to discuss how our 
two professions can improve the practice environment for all levels of 
nurses in Florida's hospitals, nursing homes, and other health care 
facilities. As you know we are always willing to participate in discussion 
designed address the nursing shortage and/or to improve the quality and 
accessibility to coast effective health care services provided in a variety 
of settings for the citizens of our state and nation. 

On a personal note I really appreciate so much your offer for the 
opportunity to meet the President when he was here in Orlando on Tuesday. 
That you would even consider giving me that honor in humbling and deeply 
appreciated.

trade opportunities for America's farmers, workers, families, and consumers. 

     Trade Promotion Authority is a key part of our trade agenda.  It will help 
us pursue and complete trade agreements, including the global trade negotiations 
launched last month in Doha, Qatar.  By promoting open trade, we expand export 
markets and create high-paying jobs for Americans, while providing opportunities 
for other nations as a result of free trade. 

     Now that the House has acted, I urge the Senate to move quickly to send me 
a Trade Promotion Authority bill I can sign.

               Statement by Secretary of Commerce Don Evans

I commend the House leadership for bringing Trade Promotion Authority up 
for a vote and I congratulate both the Republicans and the Democrats who 
stood strong and voted for its passage. Today's vote was a win for 
expanding trade; a win for American leadership around the world; a win for 
the American worker, entrepreneur, businessman, and farmer;  and a win for 
the economic security of America. 

President Bush is committed to free trade because it is an engine of 
economic growth and security, job creation and innovation. Opening markets 
for American products and crops will result in more and better paying jobs 
for Americans and lower prices for American consumers. 

The benefits of today's vote will be felt in every home, on every factory 
floor, on every farm and up and down every Main Street in America.

Statement by USTR Robert B. Zoellick on Results 
of House Trade Promotion Authority Vote 

WASHINGTON - "Today's vote in the House of Representatives to renew Trade 
Promotion Authority is a vote for American leadership, American workers, and 
American families. It is an important step in the process of helping to 
stimulate our economic recovery, to regain momentum on trade, and to return the 
United States to its rightful place as a leader in global trade liberalization. 

"The House vote is only the first step, of course. We will now work closely with 
the Senate Finance Committee to bring Trade Promotion Authority to the Senate 
floor. 

"Today's vote will help increase momentum for our trade agenda. We are moving 
forward with the global trade negotiations launched in Doha last month, because 
we believe it is in America's strong interest to seize the opportunity to 
further open the world's markets for American farm products, goods, and 
services. We will press ahead on the practical work to achieve our vision for a 
Free Trade Area of the Americas. We expect to finalize free trade agreements 
with Chile and Singapore next year. And we will continue to press globally, 
regionally, and with other nations to open additional markets for America. 

"With passage of the Jordan and Vietnam agreements earlier this year, the 
completion of the accession of China and Taiwan into the WTO, and the recent 
launch of the global trade negotiations, the Bush Administration has 
demonstrated a commitment to restoring U.S. leadership in trade liberalization. 
We will continue to do our best to strike the strongest deal possible for 
America's workers, families, farmers, and businesses. 

"I want to thank Chairman Thomas, in particular, for his tireless efforts. We 
would not have achieved this victory without him. Chairman Dreier and his trade 
whip team have also been of great assistance to me and my associates at USTR, 
and the House Republican leadership went to great lengths to build support for 
this measure, both inside the House and outside.  I also appreciate the efforts 
of a number of pro-trade Democrats, including John Tanner, William Jefferson, 
Cal Dooley, and Jim Moran.  I appreciate their willingness to stand by the 
courage of their convictions."

850/224-4JEB 

TALLAHASSEE- During challenging times for our nation and state, Governor 
Jeb Bush and the Republican-led Legislature should be commended for 
their leadership and a successful special session. With the passage of a 
revised wartime budget, Governor Bush and the Republican-led Legislature 
have worked together to ensure that Florida's highest priorities are 
funded: 

 Education funding remains at historic levels - funding for K-12 
education has been increased during Governor Bush's tenure in office 
over $2 billion from where it was in 1998. 

 Health and human services funding, including child welfare and 
services to those in need, has increased by 31% percent since 1998. 

 Economic stimulus efforts will create 33,000 new jobs and boost 
Florida's tourism industry, still struggling as a result of the attacks 
on our nation, with $20 million for marketing campaigns. 

 $19 million in spending for various anti-terrorism and domestic 
security measures will equip our state's law and health officials with 
the tools they need to ensure that Floridians are safe. 

Even with wartime necessitated budget reductions, the state budget is 
still 20% greater than in 1998, with spending increases focused on our 
state's priorities - education, health and human services, public safety 
and the environment. Showing tremendous leadership in tough times, 
Governor Bush and the Republican-led Legislature joined together to 
overcome numerous challenges and get a difficult job done. 

The Democrat leadership and their candidates for governor, on the other 
hand, have served as mere spectators in the process. Their criticism of 
the budget and blaming of Governor Bush for the budget shortfall is 
ironic and hypocritical at best, given the facts: 

 The previous Democrat Administration left the state with a mere $1.3 
billion in reserves. Under Governor Bush's leadership, the reserves have 
been built to a record $2.9 billion - an increase of 120 percent. 
Anticipating harder times, the Governor vetoed $916 million in special 
projects to minimize Florida's spending obligations. Thanks to this 
incredible foresight and willingness to make the tough decisions, our 
state is in a position of greater financial strength. 

 Democrats in the Florida Legislature voted in favor of the last three 
budgets by 98% (1999), 100% (2000), and 89% (2001) - the same budgets 
they are now criticizing. 

 Over 90% of Democrats in the Florida Legislature voted in favor of the 
Intangibles Tax Cut in 1998, 1999, and 2000. 

"Being a leader takes more than criticizing from the sidelines. Being a 
leader means having the strength to offer realistic solutions and make 
the tough decisions," said Karen Unger, campaign manager for the 
Bush/Brogan 2002 campaign. "Governor Bush has lead. The Democrats have 
not."

Well, I'll try to change the quality of input.  Everyone should get some 
positive feedback on a regular basis...you gave me enough at the Audubon 
event last month to last a full year (or two)! 

Sorry to hear that you can't make the Everglades Coalition meeting...any 
chance you can send a video (Bob Smith sent a great candid video last year). 
I think it's important for you to continue to claim the high ground on your 
Everglades legacy...and the Coalition always requires positive feedback. 
Let me know what I can do to help with that.  

In your absence, we are asking Clay Shaw to speak at our reception on 
Thursday evening (January 3), along with Some State legislature folks. 
Should I (or you?) invite Trudi to represent you on behalf of the SFWMD? 
That would be a welcome touch with the assembled masses, as I believe they 
have great respect for her leadership as representative of your 
administration.

Dear Governor Bush, 
I've heard you speak at the Family Cafe and I know your passion to 
support persons with disabilities.  Noah, our 23 year son, has severe 
disabilities and is medically unstable.  At the past Cafe I heard you 
speak on the Choice and Control pilot project.  Noah participates in 
this 
program and I was on the committee to set up the pilot for our District 
in the Tallahassee area.  I understand this project is facing severe or 
total cuts in the budget the legislators have given to you for signing. 
Our family urges you to line item veto this.  The Project gives us the 
first opportunity in many years to provide Noah with the goods and 
services he requires.  That means he can continue to live at home with 
his family.  If he had to live in a state funded facility it would cost 
over $100,000 a year--more than 5 times what the state is currently 
spending on the Choice and Control Pilot Project for him.  Please help 
us keep our family together.  Please e-mail me if you require more 
information. 
Thanks for your consideration, Susan, Fred and Noah Redmon

Just finished our FHFC meeting for the year, and you would be grinning from 
ear to ear.  We have a strong (republican, thanks to you) board who are 
independent and bright.  We have cut back on our own budget, having more 
meetings in Tallahassee, we have changed policy that requires a developer to 
be current on all loans before ever coming before the board for changes to 
existing deals or requesting new deals, 
found alternative sources of money to fund more affordable housing, and we 
have earned the respect of the developement community and the public.......we 
have come a long way baby. 

I hope that after the holidays, that your campaign will bring you to Broward

of your incredible leadership, equality, and positive legacy on Florida.   
They must meet you, know you, look into your eyes.  Only then may some

Subject:	FYI - Gov. Branstad comments

Dear Governor Bush: 

I thought you would be interested in reading the following comments. I have 
also attached my response. 

Ven 

Quote from Chair of President Bush's Commission on Special 
Education 

Gov. Branstad (former governor of Iowa) has been appointed to serve as 
chair of the Administration's new special education commission. 
  
Following is a quote from Gov Branstad (Iowa) from an interview 
transcript. The entire transcript is available at: 
  
http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/education/schools_1-16.html 
  
GOV. TERRY BRANSTAD: In our state nearly 60 percent of the budget goes 
for education. And what we find is people are willing to invest in 
quality education, but they are also fiscally conservative. They want to 
see results. They want to see achievement for the dollars that they put 
in. I think that the federal government in its mandates in the area of 
special ed has driven up costs needlessly. I think that needs to be 
reviewed. 
  
I want to see every child have an opportunity to learn. All special 
ed children do have a right to an education, but to spend tens 
oft thousands of dollars on kids that really are not going to be able to 
support themselves or be able to really learn a great deal at the 
expense of the general education of the rest of the students is not 
fair. 

And so that has to be addressed. A lot of people are afraid of it, 
of being, you know, accused of being insensitive or whatever. I was 
in Sioux City, Iowa, yesterday, and I heard from a Teacher of the Year, 
Nancy Mounts, who had been Teacher of the Year, and the 
superintendent there about how their school is being squeezed 
because of the federal mandates in the area of special ed and 
how there needs to be more flexibility and latitude given to local 
school districts in that area. 

Dear President Bush: 

I am the father of an 18 year old daughter with Autism and Epilepsy. I just 
read Governor Branstad's (chair of Commission on Special Education) statement 
about spending money on Special Education students at the expense of Regular 
Education students. I think the Governor needs to visit some classrooms and 
avoid making blanket statements that are unsupported. 

Many years ago we use to just take our disabled students and leave them home 
or institutionalize them. Society was afraid to look at them and afraid to 
deal with them. It is now 2001 and the governor's statements sound fearfully 
like those of the past. How do we decide who is worthy of an education and 
who is not? Do we cut education off to those who only have an IQ of 80, 70, 
60 or 50?  Who is to say a child with an IQ of 50 with intense therapy and 
specialized education cannot become a productive member of society?  Studies 
show $1 dollar spent early on a special needs child, can save $7 dollars when 
the child becomes an adult. 

I think the Governor needs to be aware of the strides made by children and 
adults with disabilities. I understand the concerns of increasing costs in 
education and not getting a return for your money, but to put that on the 
backs of the least fortunate in our society is a crime. The disability 
community is one of the largest minorities in this country and it continues 
to the most discriminated against. Governor Branstad could not make the 
statement he made if he were talking about African Americans or any other 
minority group. So why is it okay to say it about the disabled?  True, there 
are many people with disabilities who cannot vote, but their families do.  

A personal friend of mine was told "put your child in an institution and have 
more children" when his son was 3 years old. Today he is 33 years old and 
holds a job with the Florida Diagnostic Learning Resource System (FDLRS). His 
IQ was below 50 when he was 3 years old. 

In closing, I hope you look carefully at who is representing you on this 
commission. There are over 60 million people with disabilities in this 
country and I can assure you that education is one of the most important 
things to our families who have children with disabilities. The laws (94-152, 
504, ADA, IDEA) were created to protect our rights and we will fight to keep 
them in place and make sure our children become productive members of 
society.

Subject:	RE: thanks for your response.

Thanks for taking the time out of your very busy day to respond. I hope to use some of what you've written in a column, though I'm going a different route in my assessment of what's wrong in the system. I believe you're right on target about ending social promotion, and the districts not doing what they should. But I think true reform would start all kids in pre-K because the earlier the better, particularly for disadvantaged kids who don't get reading at home, etc. It's become fashionable for middle-class and upper-middle class parents to "hold back" Johnny in pre-K for a year to get him really prepared and "mature" for kindergarten, and private schools retain kids all the time in pre-K and kindergarten. I've seen it over the years at St. James. I know your K-20 plan doesn't cover pre-K and that program, which never has received adequate funding, now falls to day care groups. I talked to Phil Handy about it when he came to speak to the ed board about the new education structure, but he said it's something that's on the table and open for discussion. 
 
Well, the dinner turned out lovely. I noticed that the group's awards to public officials all went to Republicans. Sheriff Beary was there and Rep. Ric Keller sent his Hispanic outreach guy, Joe Mantilla.(Keller also sent a video and blamed you for his rotten Spanish -- teehee). Crotty sent a video, too. The GOP is working harder than the Dems around here... but you may have heard that already. I did notice that your accent on the tape was more noticeable. Que pasa .. no estas practicando con Columba?
 
One last note re Reading by 9. The paper really is committed, and I think part of that is that you have an editor and a managing editor at this paper now who both have young children attending public schools. (And I've got one in public high school) That says something about their commitment and the stake they have in Florida's public education system. By the way, I have volunteered along with about a dozen others at the paper to be a tutor for the Reading by 9 program at a nearby school for at least nine weeks. I look forward to it.
 
Hope to catch you next time your in Orlando.

Miriam, I am obviously not at the dinner and committed to be there. 
 
On social promotion, the FCAT is but one criteria. Sadly, many districts are lacking the courage to hold back students and remediate. It is a shame and a quiet scandal. However, our proposed enhancements of the grading system will help focus the districts on the kids left behind. If approved in the next weeks, if schools ignore the kids that are struggling, they will be penalized. 
 
In addition, based on the districts' non compliance with the intent of the A plus plan, there is the strong possibility of legislative reforms to tighten the requirements regarding social promotion. I would support reasonable reforms in this regard. 
 
I really appreciate the efforts of the Orlando Sentinel in advancing the cause of reading and student achievement. It is and will continue to make a difference. No other paper is focused on this and your involvement will have a statewide impact.

I plan to be at the Hispanic ministers dinner tonight to hear your speech, and I hope you have a minute to talk to me about the social-promotion issue and how school districts are ignoring the requirement to hold back fourth graders who fail the FCAT. Some of the educators I've interviewed in Orange County feel it's wrong to hold kids back based mostly on the results of one test. My understanding is that the test is one of many factors, but it does carry a lot of weight in the decision. Is that accurate? Also, how many times can a child re-take the FCAT? Any?

Subject:	SBA Loan Request

Hon. Governor Jeb Bush: 

Thanks for your support.  I was overwhelmed by the support shown for 
Transtar by the President, HUD Secretary Martinez, Mayor Hood, and you at 
the recent Town Hall Meeting.  However, the feedback from Thomas Butler of 
the SBA is that Transtar exceeds the size standards for small businesses.  
Therefore, the loan application that would provide the assistance necessary 
for Transtar to resume doing business at Orlando International Airport has 
been declined. 

I find myself asking for your urgent help in this matter.  Transtar was very 
important to this community, as it employed over 250 people.  The shutting 
down of Transtar had a direct impact on nearly 1000 individuals, not to 
mention Transtar's local suppliers and their employees. 

Transtar was dealt a deathblow by the events of September 11.  As you can 
imagine, time is of the essence.  Transtar faces several major challenges in 
the next few days.  Cancellation of the OIA contract is pending if no help 
is forthcoming. If the OIA contract is cancelled and the bond is called, it 
is not likely that Transtar or myself will ever be able to do business again 
with the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority.  Even with financial help to 
resume operations, Transtar faces additional challenges in structuring an 
ongoing relationship with GOAA. 

Over the past 16 years, I have more than demonstrated my ability to survive 
in a very difficult and competitive environment.  Before September 11, I 
built the business with personal resources and private sector financing.  I 
have never applied for government-backed assistance.  However, September 11 
created special needs, which require special solutions. 

Perhaps I can appeal for a special waiver in view of the employment 
represented by Transtar and its DBE status.  Perhaps there are other forms 
of state or federal aid that can mitigate this hardship.  There are many 
compelling reasons to support efforts to get Transtar back in business.  At 
this time I really need your guidance in dealing with this matter.  Governor 
Bush, I know that you are extremely busy, and your immediate attention of 
this matter would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks again for your support and 
guidance. 

Respectfully Yours, 
Robert T. Gaye

I understand this project is to be cut either part or whole in the budget the legislators have given to you for signing.  I urge you to line item veto this.  The nursing agency can not staff our case full time, my wife had to quit work to fill the gaps.  This project has been able to help make up some of this lost income.  We are a family of four living on just 24,000.00 a year.  As a state worker even that is in question.  With the project we have been able to get items my son has needed for years to help him live at home with the family.  I could go on, but I know time is as important to you as it to me.  If I can help in anyway to keep this project alive contact me at 443-7015 this is a Tallahassee number.  Thank you,  Shawn Pearson

Lori,
 
I have been getting lots of questions about A.B.L.E. from my membership. As I find myself telling them over and over that I'd like to answer them, and that although I have asked many direct questions I still do not have direct answers, it gives me great pause. The last question relating to compensation was not answered directly - and although I accepted your unwillingness to share where the money comes from one month ago, I realize that most of my direct questions have not been answered. I'm sure you can understand that when you propose to people that there will be enough money to cover any need without using government support and grants they do have a right to understand where the money is coming from. Your are proposing something unconventional, and yet are expecting loving and caring parents to go on faith alone... that is what they have spent many years doing and they cannot. In other words, my organization WILL NOT accept money unless we know who the source is, and by the same token, I as a responsible parent will not let my kids participate in anything that I am not fully clear about. To that end, SPARC cannot stand behind A.B.L.E. in that our attempts to understand by asking questions have failed. We are a humble group of parents who have never thought of stealing an idea from someone, as you have insinuated we may do if we learned your source before the meeting. I guess it shows your lack of trust in us. You also asked me to think of leadership in my community... and yet have given me no tools with which to explain to them what exactly this is. 
 
I apologize for waiting this long to share my feelings with you. I have been having "red flags" for a while. A big one occurred in our phone conversation when you said, " Some people actually have the nerve to ask if we're a religious organization". I told you that I was one who asked the question because it's important for me to allow personal relationships with God to be separate from SPARC. And yet it seemed to me that you were unnerved by the question, not even realizing that when something so unusual is proposed, people have a dire need to understand its origins. 
 
I have tried to go on faith alone, but it is irresponsible for me to continue this way. Therefore, I am canceling the meeting for the 12th and do not wish to pursue the A.B.L.E. Center. I will send a mailer to my membership, and I will also post the cancellation on the e-mail exchange. 
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Mary O'Meara

Hi Mary -
 
Just wanted to touch base and see how you are doing and about the response for the meeting next week.  Is there anything you need for the meeting?  Do you have any idea of how many people?
 
With the recent news of funding cutbacks, we're getting inundated with emails from people desperate for an A.B.L.E. Center in their community.  Families are really desperate especially with the winter school break in a couple of weeks and parents have no place for their children with disabilities during the day.  Encourage them to keep the faith - together, we will make their dreams a reality.
 
God Bless
 
Lori

At the past Cafe I heard you speak on the Choice and Control pilot project.  My son Kent Pearson is a participate in this program and I was on the committee to set up the pilot for our District in the Tallahassee area.  I understand this project is to be cut either part or whole in the budget the legislators have given to you for signing.  I urge you to line item veto this.  The nursing agency can not staff our case full time, my wife had to quit work to fill the gaps.  This project has been able to help make up some of this lost income.  We are a family of four living on just 24,000.00 a year.  As a state worker even that is in question.  With the project we have been able to get items my son has needed for years to help him live at home with the family.  I could go on, but I know time is as important to you as it to me.  If I can help in anyway to keep this project alive contact me at 443-7015 this is a Tallahassee number.  Thank you,  Shawn Pearson

Subject: Possible Scam relating to our disabled population



Dear Governor Bush,
 
I would not normally contact you with the details of the goings on in our community, but I think that I am a target for a Scientology scam.
 
My name is Mary O'Meara and I am the president of S.P.A.R.C. of Volusia, Inc. (Special Population Activities & Recreation Council). We are a 501 (c) 3 Florida non-profit, and our organization provides recreational, athletic, social and educational activities for mentally challenged people in Volusia County. I live in New Smyrna Beach, and our group has been experiencing the growth and wonder of the success of reaching anyone and everyone who can benefit from our activities. We are hoping that in the future we can establish a community center to serve a lot of needs. I was planning to start writing grants for funding in 2002. We have over 150 "participants", whose age range is 3-65 who represent a myriad of disabilities.
 
My concern is that we saw an e-mail for seed money to open an "ABLE Center" and I jumped at the opportunity to learn more about it. ...Long story short, I have arranged for a meeting with Lori Bennett, "Ambassador of Hope" as she regards herself, to speak to the parents and care-givers of my group. I have recently been made aware that she may represent the Church of Scientology. Although asked many direct questions about religion and funding, Lori has never given me a direct answer. She has claimed that the seed money does not come from Federal or State funding, that it does not come from any form of grant, and that she will only disclose where the funds come from at our meeting. This meeting is scheduled for December 12th at Coronado Community United Methodist Church's "Beach Club" at 7pm. You are invited if you'd like to attend!
 
I have spent the better part of the day speaking with my attorney, surfing the internet looking for any information I can get. I was hoping to find a direct tie between the A.B.L.E. Foundation and Scientology, but I cannot find one. I have, however, received e-mails stating that some people KNOW the tie to be there. As a result I have e-mailed my mailing list and will follow up with a post card tomorrow telling ALL that I am only hosting, not backing, this organization. I have urged my families NOT to sign anything. I am a recognized and trusted entity in my county and want to keep on doing what I'm doing - it's needed and I truly enjoy it. Here's the thing: I am afraid that she will bully my desperate parents into something, or that she will make my life difficult if I don't comply with her... The information I digested regarding Scientology is horrifying, and I am actually personally afraid at this point. 
 
I am hoping for some input, advice or reassurance - who knows what - mostly because I feel that all of my work can be ruined in one fell swoop. Do you have any information on this church in Florida? Lori Bennett is the CEO of "The A.B.L.E. (Achieving Beyond Limited Expectations) Foundation, Inc,  - as it's worded in the Division of Corporations website - and her family members are the other directors. She lives in Williston, Florida. There is some connection with Illinois, as our meeting invitations came from zip code 60499 in South Suburban Illinois - although when I asked her about the postmark she did not answer my question satisfactorily. I am hoping that we can stop this before other counties are possibly taken advantage of also. I have included the ABLE website and hope that perhaps your office can look it over thoroughly... it seems to say a lot while saying very little, and yet I felt obliged to investigate it as something of a possibility for our county. http://www.ablefoundation.org
 
My contact information is as follows: I live at 321 Roslyn Avenue, New Smyrna Beach, FL 32168 - 
My phone number is 386-409-9292, and my e-mail is msosparc@ucnsb.net. 
 
I thank you in advance for any input you can provide.
 
Sincerely,
 
Mary S. O'Meara

She says the projects are helping the families so much, and they're crying as her staff is telling them they might be cut.  She says they don't know what they'll do.

Dear Governor Bush, 

We have just been made aware of some disturbing news...My son is one of the people who are on the Matter of Choice Project.  We entered into the Matter Of Choice Project in "Good Faith" that the program would be a testing program for Developmental Disabilities.  We risked losing our services in order to help Developmental Disabilities make their system more cost effective.  Now, we are being told that Developmental Disabilities has overspent more than $80 million (or some unGodly amount like that!).  It seems to me, you are asking our children to pay for something that obviously didn't have the proper  Checks and Balances System! 

We were originally told the project would be coming to an end as of June 2002.  Then, we were told the project would be coming to an end as of March 2002.  Last weekend, I attended a Family Care Council Chairperson's Meeting in Orlando and Mr. Carl Littlefield informed us the project would be ending in January 2002.  This evening, I just received a phone call from our FCC Chairperson informing us The Matter of Choice Program will be ending this Monday, Dec. 10th!!!  Which one is it?  How can we plan for our children's daily care if we can't even count on what we are told?  We can't help but feel as though we are being manipulated!!! 

We can't begin to plan for our children's daily care!!!  The dates keep changing...there is no time to look for any other sources, support coordinators, support services, transportation to jobs, day programs, etc.!!   

How can you take our services away when we haven't even been officially notified?  When were we going to be told?  We are lucky, we are informed because we are a part of the Family Care Council and so we know people who called us when this came down today, Wednesday!  What about the people who don't have the connections like us?  When would they find out?  Monday...when there would be no services?  No one would come for respite, daily care, transportation, job coaching...? 

Our children depend on these services for their daily living...to live in our communities as independent adults.  They want to be independent and lead productive lives just like any other person their age...these services allow that to happen!!  And now, they are being taken away without proper notice and without any explanations of other options! 

This is totally unfair and not being done in "Good Faith"!!!  We are very disappointed!!! 

Please show us and our children respect and give them their dignity!!  If the project must come to an end, give us proper notice and time to make the necessary adjustments!!  We need to be allowed back into the system in a timely manner in order to not disrupt our children's lives!!! 

I look forward to hearing from you on this matter! 

Sincerely,

Miriam, I am obviously not at the dinner and committed to be there. 
 
On social promotion, the FCAT is but one criteria. Sadly, many districts are lacking the courage to hold back students and remediate. It is a shame and a quiet scandal. However, our proposed enhancements of the grading system will help focus the districts on the kids left behind. If approved in the next weeks, if schools ignore the kids that are struggling, they will be penalized. 
 
In addition, based on the districts' non compliance with the intent of the A plus plan, there is the strong possibility of legislative reforms to tighten the requirements regarding social promotion. I would support reasonable reforms in this regard. 
 
I really appreciate the efforts of the Orlando Sentinel in advancing the cause of reading and student achievement. It is and will continue to make a difference. No other paper is focused on this and your involvement will have a statewide impact.

I plan to be at the Hispanic ministers dinner tonight to hear your speech, and I hope you have a minute to talk to me about the social-promotion issue and how school districts are ignoring the requirement to hold back fourth graders who fail the FCAT. Some of the educators I've interviewed in Orange County feel it's wrong to hold kids back based mostly on the results of one test. My understanding is that the test is one of many factors, but it does carry a lot of weight in the decision. Is that accurate? Also, how many times can a child re-take the FCAT? Any?

If you won't have the time for a brief couple questions  from me tonight on this topic, would you have a minute to respond via email? Thanks, Myriam

Governor,

We will continue to monitor the system through this afternoon and expect a final assessment no later than tomorrow morning.  FWIW,  Bruce has been a big help and a joy to work with.

P.S.  a more detailed/technical assessment of the situation follows: 
 

Statement of the Problem:

The client was experiencing a problem getting their Blackberry wireless email device to synchronize with Outlook. A generic method (POP3) was used to download email messages from an Exchange server to a laptop. The Blackberry was also used to receive email via wireless. When the Blackberry was placed in the cradle attached to a laptop it would not "synchronize" with Exchange or Outlook on the laptop. In other words, messages that were received, read, deleted, or replied to with the Blackberry were updated on neither the Exchange Server nor Outlook. 

The Analysis:

The Blackberry device will not work with the generic method (POP3) of handling emails. Blackberry requires that its cradle and attached computer have a direct connection to the Exchange Server.  Blackberry synchronizes with the Exchange Server, not Outlook. 

The Solution:

We configured the laptop with an Outlook profile to connect directly to the Exchange Server.  The Blackberry device now works. When the device is put in the cradle it automatically updates the Exchange Server and, by extension, Outlook. We further modified Outlook to use "offline" folders. This provides two major advantages. First, it allows Outlook to be used without an Internet connection. Emails may be managed normally. The next time Outlook is connected to Exchange, it again synchronizes (e.g. sending or deleting emails). The second advantage to this solution is that it requires the least direct communication with Exchange. This is a benefit when operating on a dial-up or low bandwidth line. Using Outlook with offline folders will not significantly degrade performance compared to using Outlook with a POP3 connection. 

In summary, we recommend to Bruce to discontinue using POP3.  Instead, use a direct connection to Exchange with Outlooks offline folders enabled. He is going to implement the solution this afternoon. Their ISP will reconfigure their firewall to enable communication this afternoon. Bruce will also reconfigure their Exchange 2000 Server. Infinity has created a modification for the Exchange Server for Bruce to use.  Infinity will meet with Bruce at 1pm today to assist in the process.

Dear Governor, 
    You have been kind enough to respond to our previous emails, we hope that 
you will take the time to respond to this one as well. 
    We just heard from Denese Anderson, who is the director of the Choice and 
Control pilot project that the state legislature has approved a bill to cut 
the funding for this project.  That bill is now waiting for your signature. 
    We understand the difficult situation that you're faced with, however, we 
would like for you to know that the Choice and Control project has been of 
great benefit to our family and to many others as well. 
      If the funding for this is cut, we will be forced to either deny our 
family members (in our case, our son Joseph) needed services or try to find a 
way to pay for these services from our own funds.  This would place many into 
a situation of hardship. 
    We would greatly appreciate your consideration regarding this matter.

Dear Governor Bush:

When I heard you were coming to St. Lucie County, I wanted to personally
thank you once again for all the support you have given mentoring programs
throughout Florida!  I understand that your appointment schedule for that
day is very full, so I'm taking this opportunity to thank you by e-mail.

Today has been such an incredible day.   We heard about J.D. Alexander's
petition and then his impassioned plea on the House floor this morning.
He is a true representative leader who has delivered a powerful message
about standing up for our children through mentoring.  But this is
something you live, every day, by example as you mentor.   Your long
standing leadership and commitment has made such a difference! You are a
visible driving force that hundreds (perhaps thousands) have followed into
mentoring.

Whatever happens over the next few weeks, we owe both  you  and J.D.
Alexander a true debt of gratitude on behalf of our children at Big
Brothers Big Sisters.   They say it's as simple as putting a friend in the
life of a child but as essential as putting hope in a child's future.  We
see living examples of this every day through mentoring.

Thank you for all you do!

Sincerely,

Judi Miller
Big Brothers Big Sisters State Association of Florida

You probably don't get enough positive feedback on your work with the WMD's.

I wanted to let you know that while we have periodic differences of opinion
on some issues, the improvement seen with the new Board and staff structure
at the South Florida Water Management District under Trudi Williams and
Henry Dean, respectively has been incredible.  

Congratulations on making this happen!

I will have the necessary paperwork sent to him so he can apply for firearm authority. He does have a problem with the residency requirement for firearm authority, and will have to apply for a waiver of the rules of clemency.

Dear Gov. Bush (Jeb) ,
 
My name is Ed French (Edwin C. French III) ,
I am writing as per several sources state that you are probably the only person that can help and might consider helping me with this problem . I am originally a born-and-raised Floridian who now resides in the State of Arizona . Nearly all of my childhood family ties remain in Orlando and surrounding areas .
 
In 1981 , I was sentenced after submitting a guilty plea for a white-collar non-violent crime for which I served time on in the Deland facility for Volusia County . The Honorable McFerrin Smith was acting Judge in this case during Sept. of 1981 . Four months after I was introduced to facility my case was reviewed , between going from Maximum security at time of intake to Trustee in three months , my 1 year sentence was commuted to probation and I was released the morning before Christmas .
 
Jeb , since that time ( 20 years ago ) , I have been a productive taxpayer , model employee , devoted husband and most recently an exuberant and loving father to my 9 year old daughter Meaghan who I adore . Other than an occasional traffic citation in the first 10 years , I have not had to visit a courtroom except to seek visitation for my wife Krista's Grandaughter .
 
Now that I have given you some background on myself  we come to the issue at hand . I am a mature and responsible parent , husband and citizen . I have never had a violent background or tendency . My last 3 employers cover over 11 yrs in customer service : Tucson Medical Center - 6yrs        American Airlines- 2+ years     Spherion (corporate travel agency for Amex) 3 yrs .
 
For the vast majority of these past 20 years I have had all of my Civil Liberties restored except for the Right to Bear Arms .
I live in a fairly remote area just southwest of Tucson Az. and between our location gradually becoming more urban , the state of our World today and an overwhelming desire to be able to feel safe in our home , I am asking for your help in the only way I know how . I am hoping that somewhere deep down you can relate to what I am talking about at some level .
 
Several years ago I had inquired as to the steps neccessary to re-obtain the last liberty I was still missing and was referred to ATF for more info . They stated at that time that the only way to do this was to be granted Clemency or a Pardon from the State in which the crime was committed . I left Florida in 1985 and have been an Arizona resident since 1986 . In all this time I have been back to visit my folks on a fairly regular basis and have always respected the laws and citizens of Florida .
 
I am not exactly sure what measure you would need to use to accomplish my request should you choose to help me , but any help and/or advise is welcome . Just on a side - note , Jeb , if this is something you can't do or aren't comfortable with , I'll understand . I am just a good man that made a huge mistake early in life and have paid for it ever since .
 
Thanks for taking the time .
Respectfully ,
                                                                                            Ed French

Subject: Please Help Romanian-Amerocan Teen volunteer
Dear Governor Bush, 
Nick's story has gone to over 100,00 thousand websites.  We have heard from Uganda, Australia, Arizona, Russia, Romania, and Brazil.  The only ones we haven not heard from yet are influential people who can help us transport the backpacks safely to Romania.  We just sent the following letter to Bart Conners and Nadia Comaneci.  Hopefully they will respond.  Several other celebrities who are humanitarians have also been contacted.  We hope you or one of these other contacts will help us.  It would be good publicity for Florida since a young Florida teen volunteer is making such an incredible difference in this world.  His volunteerism can change the world for millions of orphans worldwide. 

We know that you are extremely busy.  We just need to know if you can help us.  If you can, please let us know as soon as possible.  We want to deliver supplies to Romania by Christmas. Thank you for listening and may you and your family have blessed Christmas. 

Peace and blessings, 
Connie Simon 


Dear Mr. Conners and Ms. Comaneci, 

We know that you rarely respond to private email.  However, this is an urgent matter and we hope you will make an exception. Our son, Anton Nicolai (Nick) Simon, was adopted from a Romanian orphanage in 1990. He spent his first 5 1/2 years in one of Romania's poorest orphanages. Last summer, he heard about the children who weren't adopted.  They are kids our son's age who are being released to the streets without any family, skills or education. Many live in sewers beneath Bucharest and beg for food to survive.  This upset our son, Nick, tremendously. 

He decided to do something to help them.  He started a program called Backpack Carepak to collect new and nearly new backpacks, scarves, gloves, sweatshirts, combs, caps, and socks to help them endure the harsh winter months ahead.   

Nick's story has inspired many people to better appreciate how wonderful it is to have the gift of a family.  Hundreds of young people in our local schools have donated winterwear and backpacks.  Now our greatest obstacle is finding transportation.  We were going to have a concert to raise money for transportation costs, but the anthrax threat and high cost of insurance and security put that idea on hold indefinitely. 

Please read Nick's story located at the following web site.  It will take just a couple of minutes and we hope that you think it is worthwhile. 
http://joanbramsch.com/helpothers/backpack.shtml 

After reading it, if you want to help us, our greatest need is transportation.  If you know anyone with airline connections to Bucharest or a large plane that will transport supplies from Florida to Romania, would you please make the contacts to help us? We would deeply appreciate any help you can give Nick's project.   

Many people have been helping to make this project a success.  Kids at one school raised 500 dollars in pennies to buy backpacks.  An elderly lady knitted 100 hats for street kids.  A woman from Minnesota has made over 300 polar fleece scarves. Groups of all ages want to help these kids because Nick has inspired them to care about others who have so little. 

Nick is an outstanding young man who has overcome incredible challenges.  We are very proud of him.  We think he was the only one to get out of Orphanage #4 because he was meant to be a spokesperson for those who have no voice.  Nick wants to make a difference in this world.  Will you help him if you can?   

Nick wants to help the orphans in Romania first and then expand humanitarian aid in the future to orphans in China, Brazil, Afghanistan, Russia, and Africa.  There are millions of abandoned children worldwide in desperate need of help.  Not one major advocacy program exists today to advocate solely for orphans or abandoned children.  Nick wants to start one and will call it O.W.L.S. for Orphans Without Love or Shelter.   

Over the years, advocates have helped many worthy causes such as whales, turtles, trees, owls.  They have saved many species from harm or extinction.  We think even more people care about orphans.  We want to join together to advocate for children worldwide who need protection and shelter. Incredibly, a former orphan from Romania is leading the way. 

Thank you for reading this email and if you can help us locate a plane to deliver Backpack Carepaks to Romania before Christmas, we would be so grateful.  Any help or direction you can give this project will be deeply appreciated.  God bless you and your family. 

Most sincerely, 
The Simon Family

Gay Adoptions
*  Ron Hayes - Reporter - Palm Beach Post - Contact:  Owen Roach
Query:  doing a story on adoptions in general with mention of homosexual
adoptions.  Wanted a copy of page 4 of the department's adoptive parent
application form which asks the "are you a homosexual" question.
Response:  faxed the requested information to Hayes.
* Jane Adams -- Reporter -- Rosie (O'Donnell) Magazine       Contact:
LaNedra Carroll
Question: Ms. Adams has been calling for several days to get a response
about the Lofton/Croteau (gay adoption) case.
Response: Told her that AFSA, the federal law, made permanency a goal for
kids who are in foster care. Told her that we can't talk about specific
cases, despite the fact that this case has been widely reported. She asked
about the number of kids in care (more than 10,000 as of October), the
number of kids who have been in long-term foster care for eight years or
more (don't know; will see if we can come up with the number); the number
of kids who have been TPR'd (about 3,500) and how many adoptive parents
there are (don't know).
Her story is probably going to run in the February issue.

District 10 Contracts
*  Shana Gruskin - Reporter - Sun-Sentinel - Contact:  Owen Roach
Query:  working on a daily story about a contract debate/dispute in Broward
County between contracted foster care providers and the department.
Negotiation is taking place as the existing contracts expire 31 Dec 01 and
the providers are taking umbrage with the new contracts.  Has the formula
for the contract changed on a district basis or as a result of directions
from Tallahassee?
Response:  Yes, they've changed and the change is directed by central
office.  The department is implementing new contracts for group care
providers that address a number of issues, primarily the difference between
what we pay for and purchase and what the providers bill Medicaid for.
This will help to prevent double-dipping.  Secondly, the new version
requires quarterly financial reports from the providers to give us a
clearer picture of true costs.  This will allow us to better monitor the
contracts and to beef up and improve them.

Bonnie L/Judge Moreno
* Joe Oglesby -- Editorial Page Editor, Miami Herald         Contact:
LaNedra Carroll
Question: Wanted to talk about Judge Moreno's ruling in Bonnie L. He wanted
to ask about where the district goes from here, what the plan is for
keeping the children who are in the system safe, etc. Wanted an interview
with the secretary.
Response: Would try very hard to get them together. If not, he will be
talking to the district administrator, the family safety director and me
about improvements; that this is Judge M's second ruling in the
department's favor -- which in effect is a vote of confidence; HomeSafeNet;
how the department is strongly following the recommendations of the Palm
Beach Grand Jury, the District 7 Strike Force and making major efforts to
improve the quality of care for our children.


Other issues:
* About the "20/20 Give Me A Break" situation....
In Polk County Judge Prince dismissed on father's attorney's motion after
we finished with our witnesses.
Before the hearing, mom read a written statement to the media on her view,
which was positive toward the department.

20/20 had an affiliate station shooting for them.-
Regional PIO Shawnna Lee and Ann Hipson, from District 14, talked briefly
to the local print media to say: "We file petitions in good faith, give our
evidence and it's up to the Judge to decide." Our attorney was asked  if we
could appeal, and she simply explained the process. She said no decision
had been made about whether to appeal.

Finally, we faxed the response that was read to you this morning to
Producer Karen Saunders, basically saying that we can't comment on open
child-protection cases. We referred her to Online Sunshine for information
about our child protection system.

1. Alan Harten, Sarasota Herald Tribune.  Requested information on why two

uncommon for two projects to be approved in the same area/county/city as
long as they meet the criteria within the application process.  He also
requested a copy of the funded list, it is available at

2. Randy Abraham, Plantation News.  Again, requested information regarding
the FCT award list from Nov. 30, specifically the project PLANTATION CENTRAL
OPEN SPACE.  Ann Rowe advised him the project is on the "contingent funded
list", meaning FCT anticipates that funding will come available and the City
of Plantation will be notified if/when.  He asked if most cities go ahead
with their plans/project anyway?  Yes, they normally do.

3. Page St. John, Gannett News Service.  Requested information regarding the
State Housing Trust Fund - what is the main funding source?  What are the
limitations - statutorily or constitutional?  Ann Rowe advised that the
Trust Fund is primarily funded through the Doc Stamp tax, and that the
limitations are statutorily.

they are not salary incentives per se, but one time training incentive
payments for certified employee training as in hostage training.  All law
enforcement gets these training incentives If you divide the $4 million by
20,000 DOC certified employees it comes to out $200 one time only payment
per officer.

Dear Governor:

Today the Legislature passed Senate Bill 52-C delaying the effective date of
the Florida Building Code from January 1, 2002 to March 1, 2002.

The Florida Building Commission, your body of technical advisors, voted
unanimously both at the October and November meetings to recommend to you
that the code go into effect on January 1, 2002.

Should you decide to veto this bill it would enormously strengthen the
ability of the Florida Building Commission to promote consensus within the
industry in the future.

Governor, 
 
In the 1980's the Trustees gave the land to Miami-Dade County with a reverter clause stating that if the county failed to use the property for public uses (i.e. commercial ventures) that the property automatically reverts to the Trustee's ownership.  
 
The County was seeking permits on the marina proposal when DEP found out that there was a casino gambling boat docked there.  We issued a legal notice that the gambling vessel constitutes a private venture and that they needed to remove the vessel or we would take positive action to evict the vessel.  Miami-Dade is challenging this action because they receive $900,000 annually from the boat. So everything else they are proposing is being held up on a determination of who owns the land.  We argue that the land has automatically reverted to us because they are using it for commercial purposes.  They argue that we have to take some action. 
 
The matter is likely to become a cabinet item in January 2002, if we cannot come to conclusion. 
 
ON the proposal for the marina, golf driving range, etc.   I am not sure how much of it is on land that we own vs. land that Miami-Dade owns.  That will be the key for what we have authority to negotiate. 
 
I will find out.

Honorable Governor Bush, 

Our County Park is under siege by the political games played in Dade County. 
The Parks Department along with the Honorable Gwen Margolis have 
orchestrated a plan to commercialize Haulover Park in Dade County. The park 
is bordered by the ocean and Intercoastal and provides access to many 
minority groups living west of Biscayne Boulevard. I solicited their 
comments through a public awareness campaign held on Labor Day. Their 
suggestions were that the county should concentrate their efforts on better 
bathrooms, sand boxes for the kids, picnic tables and more. They are not 
aware of the assault on their access through increased parking concessions, 
privatized dock space that will destroy the breathtaking views of the 
intercoastal, and an overall commercialization of the Park. 

The FDEP West Palm Beach, recently denied an application for an expansion of 
the dock facility that presently houses a GAMING vessel, which was in the 
park ILLEGALLY, and authorized by the county. 

I ask you to further review, contest, and revoke an existing permit that 
allows the county to expand the Marina additionally for private use with 
over 150 new slips for rent, a 350' intrusion into the intercoastal, 300 
yard driving range with a 60' net, and other commercial operations at the 
park. These proposed changes do not serve the PUBLIC interest and 
generations to come will suffer if their allowed to proceed unchecked.

Dear Governor Bush:

When I heard you were coming to St. Lucie County, I wanted to personally
thank you once again for all the support you have given mentoring programs
throughout Florida!  I understand that your appointment schedule for that
day is very full, so I'm taking this opportunity to thank you by e-mail.

Today has been such an incredible day.   We heard about J.D. Alexander's
petition and then his impassioned plea on the House floor this morning.
He is a true representative leader who has delivered a powerful message
about standing up for our children through mentoring.  But this is
something you live, every day, by example as you mentor.   Your long
standing leadership and commitment has made such a difference! You are a
visible driving force that hundreds (perhaps thousands) have followed into
mentoring.

Whatever happens over the next few weeks, we owe both  you  and J.D.
Alexander a true debt of gratitude on behalf of our children at Big
Brothers Big Sisters.   They say it's as simple as putting a friend in the
life of a child but as essential as putting hope in a child's future.  We
see living examples of this every day through mentoring.

Thank you for all you do!

Subject:	Florida Building Code

Dear Governor Bush,

I am writing to express my disappointment and disbelief that The Senate and
House has once again voted to delay the Florida Building Code. I wrote to
you last week expressing my feelings and giving you an understanding of what
the severity of this action means to our company, but I feel I must do it
again, since you are the last possible chance I have to save my business.

My name is Peter Merhige and my company is Protective Glass Industries,
located in Ft Myers, Florida. My company was formed over 2 years ago for the
purpose of developing and bringing to market a new product for the hurricane
protection markets. The reason for forming the company and products was for
the potential in the hurricane markets mainly due to the
development of the new Florida building code (THE CODE IN WHICH YOU AGREED
WAS GOOD FOR FLORIDA) that contains hurricane protection. We have designed
and have patents pending on the finest impact glass product in the industry.
Not only does it protect from hurricane damage but also due to it's
insulating properties, reduces the cost of energy. We have spent well over
$1,000,000 on the development and commercialization of our products and due
to several delays in the statewide building code; we have lost millions of
dollars. Over the last 2 days, I have lost close to $1 MILLION in investment
money because of the actions in Tallahassee. Not only has our company spent
over $1,000,000 but also there has been millions and millions of dollars
already spent to develop this code, along with millions and millions of
dollars spent by companies to enhance their products to meet the new codes.
There are hundreds of companies ready to provide product for these new
building codes and there has been more than ample time to prepare for it.

I do not know how to make this any clearer than to tell you that all of mine
and all of my loyal employees' hard work to develop our products and bring
them to market over the last 2+ years is over unless you help. We had the
potential to create over 100 jobs for the state of Florida with revenues
over $100 million dollars over the next 3 years, which would obviously be
put back into the Florida economy while protecting your citizens. We have
close to 20 companies that were getting set to come to market with our glass
the first of the year because of your code, and due to the delay, they will
not until March (if the code doesn't get eliminated all together). Due to
this delay and the uncertainty of Tallahassee which makes my investors
uncomfortable enough to not invest, I will not be able to keep the doors
open. Your are really my last hope to see that Tallahassee actually thinks
of it's citizens over their own personal agendas.

We worked very hard to present ideas that would make sense for everyone and
had some really good suggestions, but because of obvious personal agendas,
we were ignored. Presently Senators McKay, Clary and Constatine along with
Representative Bennet, who have businesses in the construction industry,
stated that Florida's counties were not ready for the code. Ourselves, The
Florida League of Cities, AIF and many more, have proof through the DCA that
only 8% of Florida was not ready to enforce the code.

We suggested that all counties not ready be given a 60 day delay to get
prepared and the other 92% who have worked extremely hard to do what you
wanted, enforce the code as scheduled. I cannot, even in my worst
nightmares, imagine how this would not satisfy everyone if that was their
true objections. Obviously it was not and Politics once again was Politics.

As I stated, you are our last chance. We are not alone. There are many
companies that will be put out of business because of this action. I do know
you have the power to make this right. I am begging you for the opportunity
to meet with you to politely express the feelings and concerns of our
company and our industry before you sign the bill to put us out of business.
I don't think this is an unfair request since Tallahassee has potentially
stripped my life from me.

I hope to hear from you or your office soon.

Respectfully,

Dear Jeb.....
It is my understanding that the mail order pilot program for diabetes for patients along the I-4 corridor (Central Florida) requires that patients receive their diabetic medications and supplies through an out of state provider Health Alliance.  Not only is that an outrage for businesses within this state but that it makes no sense at all medically.- it is dangerous to the patient.  Our pharmacy presently provides medication management for the Senior Resource Alliance which includes 5 counties in Central Florida.  We monitor not only their diabetes but also the diseases which are a direct result on non-compliance,  inappropriate use of medication, failure to properly educate, etc.  And- it is at no charge to anyone including the Medicaid program. There is no way to control the health of these people with the therapy bifurcated and with incomplete patient history at our pharmacy.   It is inconceivable that you would allow this to go to a company which up to this point has not performed in a satisfactory matter when you have a woman owned business in this state (and a staunch Republican member of the Republican Congressional Committee Business Advisory Council) right here in Central Florida (Orlando).  I understand that you will be in Orlando tomorrow and I would hope that you would have a few moments to speak with me as I have been invited by Rich Crotty to attend-as a member of OCREC.  Please e-mail me concerning this.  Thank you.

Dear Gov. Bush (Jeb) ,
 
My name is Ed French (Edwin C. French III) ,
I am writing as per several sources state that you are probably the only person that can help and might consider helping me with this problem . I am originally a born-and-raised Floridian who now resides in the State of Arizona . Nearly all of my childhood family ties remain in Orlando and surrounding areas .
 
In 1981 , I was sentenced after submitting a guilty plea for a white-collar non-violent crime for which I served time on in the Deland facility for Volusia County . The Honorable McFerrin Smith was acting Judge in this case during Sept. of 1981 . Four months after I was introduced to facility my case was reviewed , between going from Maximum security at time of intake to Trustee in three months , my 1 year sentence was commuted to probation and I was released the morning before Christmas .
 
Jeb , since that time ( 20 years ago ) , I have been a productive taxpayer , model employee , devoted husband and most recently an exuberant and loving father to my 9 year old daughter Meaghan who I adore . Other than an occasional traffic citation in the first 10 years , I have not had to visit a courtroom except to seek visitation for my wife Krista's Grandaughter .
 
Now that I have given you some background on myself  we come to the issue at hand . I am a mature and responsible parent , husband and citizen . I have never had a violent background or tendency . My last 3 employers cover over 11 yrs in customer service : Tucson Medical Center - 6yrs        American Airlines- 2+ years     Spherion (corporate travel agency for Amex) 3 yrs .
 
For the vast majority of these past 20 years I have had all of my Civil Liberties restored except for the Right to Bear Arms .
I live in a fairly remote area just southwest of Tucson Az. and between our location gradually becoming more urban , the state of our World today and an overwhelming desire to be able to feel safe in our home , I am asking for your help in the only way I know how . I am hoping that somewhere deep down you can relate to what I am talking about at some level .
 
Several years ago I had inquired as to the steps neccessary to re-obtain the last liberty I was still missing and was referred to ATF for more info . They stated at that time that the only way to do this was to be granted Clemency or a Pardon from the State in which the crime was committed . I left Florida in 1985 and have been an Arizona resident since 1986 . In all this time I have been back to visit my folks on a fairly regular basis and have always respected the laws and citizens of Florida .
 
I am not exactly sure what measure you would need to use to accomplish my request should you choose to help me , but any help and/or advise is welcome . Just on a side - note , Jeb , if this is something you can't do or aren't comfortable with , I'll understand . I am just a good man that made a huge mistake early in life and have paid for it ever since .
 
Thanks for taking the time .
Respectfully ,

Governor, State of Florida
Executive Office of the Governor

Tallahassee, Florida 32399
 
Dear Governor Bush,
 
I am writing to support a resolution by the Town of Surfside (#1623) that opposes the permitting and/or establishment of a commercial marina at Haulover Park.  As a national nonprofit that watches public space and urban park issues, we are very disturbed by Miami-Dade County's plans for developing this public waterfront park into a commercial zone that will deprive the majority of the public from free use of the waterfront. Furthermore, these plans have been put forth by the County without community consultation. 
 
Over the past 26 years, Project for Public Spaces has worked in over 1,000 communities and has become the leading national expert on how to create vibrant public spaces and revitalize the neighborhoods around them. In the process, we have worked with downtown development groups, neighborhood associations, foundations, government at the local, state and federal levels, merchants associations, corporations and private developers.  We have learned, through this experience, that decisions regarding public spaces need to be made in a full and open process that involves the public, and that planning efforts that eschew public participation invariably fail, either because of controversy or through lack of use by the public.  On the other hand, places that do use an inclusive visioning process can generate enormous positive spin-off effects extending far beyond the space itself and build a healthier relationship between public officials and their constituents . 
 
Furthermore, public assets need to remain public, and while private concessions may, at times, create a desirable source of revenue that contributes to better maintenance, such uses should always be complementary and supportive of the public nature of the space, rather than an intrusion on it.  It is our strong feeling that the commercial uses in Miami-Dade County's plans are entirely inappropriate for Haulover Park.
 
Thank you for your attention in these matters.

Subject:	RE: Blackberry/Outlook Solution

Governor,
 
Our tests yesterday were successful.  We are implementing the solution this afternoon.  We will continue to monitor the system through this afternoon and expect a final assessment no later than tomorrow morning.  FWIW,  Bruce has been a big help and a joy to work with.  We would have been unsuccessful without his assistance.  
 
I'll keep you posted on our progress.

------------
 
P.S.  a more detailed/technical assessment of the situation follows: 
 

Statement of the Problem:

The client was experiencing a problem getting their Blackberry wireless email device to synchronize with Outlook. A generic method (POP3) was used to download email messages from an Exchange server to a laptop. The Blackberry was also used to receive email via wireless. When the Blackberry was placed in the cradle attached to a laptop it would not "synchronize" with Exchange or Outlook on the laptop. In other words, messages that were received, read, deleted, or replied to with the Blackberry were updated on neither the Exchange Server nor Outlook. 

The Analysis:

The Blackberry device will not work with the generic method (POP3) of handling emails. Blackberry requires that its cradle and attached computer have a direct connection to the Exchange Server.  Blackberry synchronizes with the Exchange Server, not Outlook. 

The Solution:

We configured the laptop with an Outlook profile to connect directly to the Exchange Server.  The Blackberry device now works. When the device is put in the cradle it automatically updates the Exchange Server and, by extension, Outlook. We further modified Outlook to use "offline" folders. This provides two major advantages. First, it allows Outlook to be used without an Internet connection. Emails may be managed normally. The next time Outlook is connected to Exchange, it again synchronizes (e.g. sending or deleting emails). The second advantage to this solution is that it requires the least direct communication with Exchange. This is a benefit when operating on a dial-up or low bandwidth line. Using Outlook with offline folders will not significantly degrade performance compared to using Outlook with a POP3 connection. 

In summary, we recommend to Bruce to discontinue using POP3.  Instead, use a direct connection to Exchange with Outlooks offline folders enabled. He is going to implement the solution this afternoon. Their ISP will reconfigure their firewall to enable communication this afternoon. Bruce will also reconfigure their Exchange 2000 Server. Infinity has created a modification for the Exchange Server for Bruce to use.  Infinity will meet with Bruce at 1pm today to assist in the process.

Some of the educators I've interviewed in Orange County feel it's wrong to hold kids back based mostly on the results of one test.

Capitol recycling buried in inaction
State officials toss their trash, marking a retreat from a program
lawmakers
mandated in 1988.
By JULIE HAUSERMAN
 St. Petersburg Times,
published December 6, 2001
------------------------------------------------------------------------

TALLAHASSEE -- All over Florida, people are rinsing out bottles and cans
and
putting them into recycling bins. State law requires every county to
recycle.

But at the state Capitol, it's a different story. Most lawmakers,
lobbyists
and state staffers just throw bottles and cans into the trash. Even
though
the law requires it, there's no official aluminum recycling program at
the
Capitol. Informally, janitors and maids collect some aluminum cans and
turn
them in for money.

And what about paper recycling? A much-ballyhooed program to recycle the
mounds of office paper from state buildings has been mediocre at best, a
local official says.

Every week, giant loads of paper from state government offices go
straight
into the Leon County landfill. The 86 state office buildings in
Tallahassee
are recycling only 100 tons of paper a month -- about half as much as
they
could be, said Nancy Paul, the recycling coordinator for Leon County.

"There are forests that lay bare because of us," said state Rep. Lindsay
Harrington, a Punta Gorda Republican who heads the House Natural
Resources
and Environmental Protection Committee. "We are not abiding by the
laws."

The waning interest in recycling at the Capitol itself mirrors the
Legislature's gradual retreat from a recycling program that lawmakers
mandated with much fanfare in 1988.

In the years since, Florida communities have embraced recycling. But the
Legislature keeps cutting back the local grants to pay for it. Every
year,
lawmakers raid millions of dollars from recycling trust funds and use
the
money for other things.

This week, lawmakers proposed to cut recycling grants to counties
altogether
and set up a new small statewide fund of $3-million to $5-million.
Counties
would have to compete for the money. By comparison, when the Legislature
first started statewide recycling, it handed out $35-million in grants
to
counties. Each year, the pot got smaller and smaller. This year, the
state
had just $5.3-million available for county grants.

Lawmakers now want to take the millions that once paid for local
recycling
programs and use the money for other needs, such as restoring the
Everglades
and spraying pesticides to control the west Nile virus.

Even some leading Republicans are queasy about it.

"I'm really concerned that we're sending a message here," Republican
Sen.
Jim King of Jacksonville said at a committee meeting this week. "We were
so
proud in Jacksonville, we were one of the leading cities in the nation
in
terms of recycling. I'm concerned we're sending a message of "That was
then,
this is now.' I'm concerned you'll end up with piles of bottles and cans
and
plastics, and they'll end up in the same place they were before -- in
the
landfill."

Proponents of the cuts say that local community recycling programs are
thriving, and it's time for the state to pull back.

In big counties such as Hillsborough and Pinellas, the impact won't be
that
great, local officials say, because county commissions have taken on
more of
the burden when state money started to dwindle several years ago.

Small counties, though, could be hurt.

"It's a very sad situation to see Florida walk away from its commitment.
Small counties just don't have the resources," said former Republican
State
Sen. George Kirkpatrick of Gainesville, who was one of the chief
architects
of Florida's 1988 Solid Waste Management Act. "Legislators today have no
idea why we started these programs. These people are going to wake up
one
day and there's going to be trash on the roads and along the rivers, and
they are going to say: What happened?"

In 1988, Florida was the second state in the country to set a recycling
goal
for itself: 30 percent of all solid waste was supposed to be recycled by
1994.

Florida has come close to the goal but hasn't met it. The statewide
recycling rate in 1998, the last year the state totaled the figures,
stands
at about 28 percent, according to a recent Department of Environmental
Protection review of the state's recycling programs.

The state set goals for individual counties as well. Florida's 35
biggest
counties were supposed to be recycling 30 percent of their waste by
1994.
But that goal hasn't been met, either. In 1998, only nine out of those
35
counties had met the goal, the DEP report says. (In the Tampa Bay area,
only
one county, Citrus, met the 30 percent goal.)

"The fact that many counties did not achieve the goals does not mean the
effort was futile," the DEP report says, noting that Florida has more
curbside recycling programs than ever before -- 299 statewide.

Overall, Floridians are recycling about 21/2 times more garbage then
they
were a decade ago.

From a political standpoint, recycling seems more important than ever.
Not a
single new landfill has been built in Florida since 1994 because of
neighborhood opposition, the DEP report says.

Most important, recycling offers Floridians a chance to help the state's
environment hands-on.

"The people who are the biggest advocates for recycling are the citizens
of
Florida -- the kids and moms and dads," said John Schert, executive
director
of the Center for Solid and Hazardous Waste at the University of
Florida.
"They want to feel like they aren't just throwing things in a landfill,
that
someone is going to make a new product out of it."

State Sen. Ken Pruitt, R-Port St. Lucie, is leading the effort to do
away
with most county recycling grants. He says the state needed to help
counties
when programs were new, but that counties should take more
responsibility
now. He says the state has met its recycling goals "in spirit."

"We have done what the Legislature intended," Pruitt said. "Sometimes,
you
don't meet the exact percentage of the goal."

On Wednesday, the Department of Management Services, the state agency
that's
supposed to coordinate recycling at state buildings, acknowledged that
recycling at the Capitol and other state buildings isn't what it should
be.
DMS Deputy Secretary Mallory Harrell pledged to beef up the program.

"If we can provide better quality and better quantity of materials,
we'll
have better recycling," Harrell said. "We're looking at how we can do
that."

She said DMS wants to increase its paper recycling and start a viable
aluminum recycling program at the Capitol.

There are plenty of aluminum cans to recycle there. Every year, soft
drink
lobbyists haul in crates of free soda to the Capitol and hand them out
to
the masses gathered for the legislative session.

Tampa Bay recycling
Here's a look at the recycling rates that local counties reported to the
state Department of Environmental Protection in 1998.

Hillsborough -- 28 percent

Pinellas -- 24 percent

Hernando -- 27 percent

Citrus -- 31 percent

Pasco -- 13 percent

Dear Governor Bush: 

I am writing to ask if you for another favor. Would be willing to send out 
two letters? One to WJCT (our presenting PBS station) thanking them for their 
support and help in production of our special, Beyond Adversity TV and the 
other to Mr. Michael York (our host). 

Mr. Michael Boylan (President & CEO) of the station has committed staff and 
resources to get the show out even though we have been unable to come up with 
the funding necessary. They really believe in what we are doing and have been 
invaluable to our foundation. 

Mr. York was kind enough to come to Florida without payment for his services 
and host the special. 

If you are able to, I can send a draft of each letter and where to send them. 
We are diligently working to get the show out and these letters would help 
our situation. Hope to hear from you soon. 

Sincerely,

Subject:	Everglades Water Quality Standard

I spent much of yesterday in a briefing by DEP General Counsel Teri Donaldson, Ernie Barnett, and Frank Nearhoof on what they represented to me to be DEP's position regarding the Everglades phosphorus standard. 

Based on their briefing, I remain gravely concerned that what is about to be proposed will have the following effects: 

* Initiate 3 years or more of gratuitous litigation. Instead of the "best and brightest" at DEP and SFWMD being able to focus on how to ATTAIN the standard already in the law (10ppb) their time and energies will be dissipated by having to defend a rule to before an administrative law judge. Since the 10ppb standard is ALREADY in the law, there is NO value added here, only RISK. 

* Subject the formulation of a "compliance methodology" to the more difficult standards of rulemaking rather than keeping it within the more manageable confines of the permit process. The Everglades Forever Act has NO directive to DEP that authorizes a rule on compliance methodology. Compliance methodology is discussed in a SEPARATE subsection of the Everglades Forever Act with NO authority to adopt a rule attached to it (the Legislature easily COULD have granted DEP rulemaking authority associated with the compliance methodology, but chose not to). 

DEP has attempted to adopt rules under similar circumstances recently, and has LOST rule challenges on similar points. See:

 State of Florida, Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund v. Day Cruise Association, 1st District Court of Appeal, September 13, 2001

I have not yet seen the draft rule language. In the briefing yesterday, the DEP staff only showed me "bullet points"of what the rule would contain on the points of the criterion (10ppb), compliance methodology, and "net improvement" of impacted areas. 

Many of the "bullet points" sounded pretty good as to what the rule would contain, but I can't assess them with certainty until I see the actual rule language. 

However, no matter how good the draft rule appears on first blush, its benefits will be illusory if they create an unnecessary new round of litigation that the state is at risk of losing, or at best dissipating its energies and public funds in over the next several years.

Far better course of action: 

*  Announce a decision to rely on 10ppb default standard in the law because rulemaking to put the same number in a rule is redundant, and exposes the state to unnecessary litigation.

* Deal with "compliance methodology" in long term permits as originally envisioned by the Everglades Forever Act, which must be considered by DEP in 2003.

Dear Governor Bush, 

I cannot truly express how much I appreciate your continued support of our 
Nurse Practitioner Prescribing Bill. I'm sure you know by now that we were 
smashed in the House Regulation Committee on Tuesday morning.  We  do not 
consider this as defeat but rather as another hurdle that will be overcome 
while you are still our Governor. The nurses, supportive physicians, and 
Representative Green thank you for having Mike Hansen appear before the 
committee to express your support. We really felt that we would have a 
closer vote but the opposition mounted over the weekend and on Monday was 
widespread and impressive if not always completely accurate. However we are 
hearing from legislators who watched to meeting in their offices that at 
least some are beginning to see that the negative debate at times is a 
message that conveys a lack of respect for the professionalism and ethics of 
registered nurses. 

I did speak with Greg Turberville yesterday and he tells me that he has 
mentioned to FMA that they must meet with our Association to discuss how our 
two professions can improve the practice environment for all levels of 
nurses in Florida's hospitals, nursing homes, and other health care 
facilities. As you know we are always willing to participate in discussion 
designed address the nursing shortage and/or to improve the quality and 
accessibility to coast effective health care services provided in a variety 
of settings for the citizens of our state and nation. 

On a personal note I really appreciate so much your offer for the 
opportunity to meet the President when he was here in Orlando on Tuesday. 
That you would even consider giving me that honor in humbling and deeply 
appreciated.

Dear Jeb: 

      I was going through some old newspaper clippings the other day when I came across one from 1984 of your appearance before the Cuban-American Republican Club of the Palm Beaches.  There was a picture of us together, or that is, a picture of a skinny version of club president Ed Gonzalez and  guest speaker Jeb Bush. 

      But, my reason for writing though is not to reminisce, but to address the matter of my application for the Palm Beach County School Board.  Oddly, for all the years that I have been active in Republican politics, appointment to the local school board is one thing that I have sought for myself. 

      I very much regret that in November of last year I let my disappointment at not being appointed show publicly and was less than gracious in my later conversation with you.  You deserve better and I apologize. 

      No matter what, including how you decide the pending appointment, be confident that I am, have always remain, a loyal friend and supporter of yours and the Bush family.

Mike ... good work.  It is unfortunate that the Corps currently seems not to
challenge anything Fish & Wildlife (the new guy you mentioned named Jay
Slack whose wife Heather McSharry works in his office and is the F&W 
actions person for the Cape Sable Seaside Sparrow ... go figure!) 
says ... no matter how foolish or damaging ...
rationalizing F&W opinions/recommendations seems to be the norm. F&W
incessantly asks for more than is reasonable, and the Corps gives it. Thus,
Miami-Dade citizens will be in jeopardy of exacerbated flooding for at least
2 more years if the current IOP preferred alternative is chosen ... even
though this was unanimously opposed by the Miami-Dade County Flood Mgt
Task Force ... and, even more, I am quite confident it will be considerably
longer as, in my judgment, there are simply too many tough issues to 
overcome to ensure a Dec 2003 completion as required in the Biological 
Opinion ... hate for a boss to micro-manage but it's needed on this one if the 
date is going to be met. My prediction is that, with the best of intentions but 
a lack of the  requisite attention, Col May will stand by the Dec 2003
completion, leave in summer of 2003, the new guy will say "it wasn't my
fault" that Mod Waters didn't get done as I just got here, and he'll be
given his 3-year tenure to get it done ... that's the way it seems to
be headed ... unfortunately it will be the citizens of M-D county, the
Indians, and others who will continue to suffer ... all for the most incredible
foolishness I have ever witnessed ... the use of the Cape Sable Seaside
Sparrow to control water. 
 
Keep this note and we'll evaluate my prognosis
on Jan 1, 2004 ... if the Corps gets it done ... operational Mod Water that
is ... I'll have the party and buy the beer for Greg and all who made it
possible ... and eat crow ... you and other friends certainly will be invited. 
I sure hope my prediction is wrong so we can celebrate ... even on me! 
Anything for a party.
 
Anyway, we just need some courageous public servants who
understand what's right and do it ... we do have some now and hopefully
they will step forward as they have already done on other issues ... both
stand-up to the Sparrow chicanery and get Mod Waters done ASAP.

I presented the IPO letter to Col. May at the SERGE meeting today.  I
read the cover letter into the record during the public comment session
and provided copies to SFWMD, SFERTF (Rock), DOE (Everglades National
Park -- Maureen), the State (Rick Smith), USDA - Ron Smola, the County
(to go to Roman Gastesi) and the District's Water Resources Advisory
Council (Julio Fanjul).
I faxed a copy to Dexter last night.

The letter and my comments got a much more lively and lengthy reception
than I anticipated.  Col May -- who was acting as the Chairman --
immediately launched into a very articulate, but largely defensive
rebuttal.  Rick Smith really perked up when he heard that Cindy Lerner
and the Mayors endorsed our position and that you provided the technical
expertise -- seemed very concerned that the state may come out opposing
the Corp's recommendation.  Neal McAlliley opined we are "crying wolf"
again".  The US Fish and Wildlife rep -- a new guy named Jay -- tried to
assure me that the feds were working it all out and we will be OK.  But,
I got to intervene as it went along to clarify issues -- as best I could
-- and to challenge comments I thought inappropriate or inaccurate.

 Same old story -- we'll be OK once Mod Waters and C-111 are completed,
but only vague ideas of how we get through the interim period without
increasing flooding probabilities.  However, out of all the discussion,
Col. May invited you and I to sit down with him and his hydrologists to
discuss the differences in our respective opinions.  I concurred, but
asked that we be able to bring Roman along to represent the County's
perspective.

Let me know what you think we need to do next.

Frank, the difficulty for us in reaching last years expenditures is the 
reductions in current year FCO (6 million) and the decision by ARAMARK to 
cancel the PRIDE food commodities contract.  I have discussed with ARAMARK 
the importance of MBE subcontracting.  I asked ARAMARK to attend the DMS 
conference and to contact Windell Paige for ideas and vendors.  This is a 
potential 10 million dollar impact on our numbers. 

Our goal is four million less than last year.  Our budget is approximately 
40 million less as a result of this special session, including substance 
abuse contract reduction in the community and in prisons, which will affect 
some MBE providers.  

It will be a struggle to meet last year's spending.  We will strive to 
increase our spending in appropriate areas.  We are currently exploring 
medical contracts to see if there are new or additional MBE providers to 
utilize in the clinical areas. 

I will be happy to stay after the meeting to discuss further ideas.

Governor, Hank Klein and Terrence Connor, managing partner at law firm of

Honorary Chairman of the Florida Philharmonic Gala on February 2, 2002. 
Unfortunately you are unable to attend as you are keynote at Pinellas LDD. 
If you agree to serve as honorary you would allow them to use your name on 
the invitation and we would prepare a letter to be read at dinner or a 
video.

Subject:	FW: Minority Business Spending

Frank, the difficulty for us in reaching last years expenditures is the 
reductions in current year FCO (6 million) and the decision by ARAMARK to 
cancel the PRIDE food commodities contract.  I have discussed with ARAMARK 
the importance of MBE subcontracting.  I asked ARAMARK to attend the DMS 
conference and to contact Windell Paige for ideas and vendors.  This is a 
potential 10 million dollar impact on our numbers. 

Our goal is four million less than last year.  Our budget is approximately 
40 million less as a result of this special session, including substance 
abuse contract reduction in the community and in prisons, which will affect 
some MBE providers.  

It will be a struggle to meet last year's spending.  We will strive to 
increase our spending in appropriate areas.  We are currently exploring 
medical contracts to see if there are new or additional MBE providers to 
utilize in the clinical areas. 

I will be happy to stay after the meeting to discuss further ideas.

Dear Mr. President: 

First I want to acknowledge you and your Administration for the great job you are doing in leading our nation during these troubled times.

There is an issue that is not getting a lot of press but that is vital to this nation and all it's people.  Too many young children are being put into Special Education and labeled with "learning disorders" simply because they haven't been taught to read or have been "left behind" because they lack fundamental educational tools. This problem will not be fixed by labeling them and then drugging them.  I urge you not to allocate any more funding for Special Education until it has been reformed!

Subject:	Possible Scam relating to our disabled population

Dear Governor Bush,
 
I would not normally contact you with the details of the goings on in our community, but I think that I am a target for a Scientology scam.
 
My name is Mary O'Meara and I am the president of S.P.A.R.C. of Volusia, Inc. (Special Population Activities & Recreation Council). We are a 501 (c) 3 Florida non-profit, and our organization provides recreational, athletic, social and educational activities for mentally challenged people in Volusia County. I live in New Smyrna Beach, and our group has been experiencing the growth and wonder of the success of reaching anyone and everyone who can benefit from our activities. We are hoping that in the future we can establish a community center to serve a lot of needs. I was planning to start writing grants for funding in 2002. We have over 150 "participants", whose age range is 3-65 who represent a myriad of disabilities.
 
My concern is that we saw an e-mail for seed money to open an "ABLE Center" and I jumped at the opportunity to learn more about it. ...Long story short, I have arranged for a meeting with Lori Bennett, "Ambassador of Hope" as she regards herself, to speak to the parents and care-givers of my group. I have recently been made aware that she may represent the Church of Scientology. Although asked many direct questions about religion and funding, Lori has never given me a direct answer. She has claimed that the seed money does not come from Federal or State funding, that it does not come from any form of grant, and that she will only disclose where the funds come from at our meeting. This meeting is scheduled for December 12th at Coronado Community United Methodist Church's "Beach Club" at 7pm. You are invited if you'd like to attend!
 
I have spent the better part of the day speaking with my attorney, surfing the internet looking for any information I can get. I was hoping to find a direct tie between the A.B.L.E. Foundation and Scientology, but I cannot find one. I have, however, received e-mails stating that some people KNOW the tie to be there. As a result I have e-mailed my mailing list and will follow up with a post card tomorrow telling ALL that I am only hosting, not backing, this organization. I have urged my families NOT to sign anything. I am a recognized and trusted entity in my county and want to keep on doing what I'm doing - it's needed and I truly enjoy it. Here's the thing: I am afraid that she will bully my desperate parents into something, or that she will make my life difficult if I don't comply with her... The information I digested regarding Scientology is horrifying, and I am actually personally afraid at this point. 
 
I am hoping for some input, advice or reassurance - who knows what - mostly because I feel that all of my work can be ruined in one fell swoop. Do you have any information on this church in Florida? Lori Bennett is the CEO of "The A.B.L.E. (Achieving Beyond Limited Expectations) Foundation, Inc,  - as it's worded in the Division of Corporations website - and her family members are the other directors. She lives in Williston, Florida. There is some connection with Illinois, as our meeting invitations came from zip code 60499 in South Suburban Illinois - although when I asked her about the postmark she did not answer my question satisfactorily. I am hoping that we can stop this before other counties are possibly taken advantage of also. I have included the ABLE website and hope that perhaps your office can look it over thoroughly... it seems to say a lot while saying very little, and yet I felt obliged to investigate it as something of a possibility for our county. http://www.ablefoundation.org
 
My contact information is as follows: I live at 321 Roslyn Avenue, New Smyrna Beach, FL 32168 - 
My phone number is 386-409-9292, and my e-mail is msosparc@ucnsb.net. 
 
I thank you in advance for any input you can provide.
 
Sincerely,
 
Mary S. O'Meara

Governor Bush, 

I am the guy who back before you ran for office, sent you a letter, that I 
supported you, I believed in you and when the day came, I voted for you. 
Then later, when you went into office, you allowed me to bring my boy and 
wife over and have our picture taken.  When you implimented making 
modifications to the career service system, I sent you a letter that I 
backed you and you sent it back to me, with your signature and a thank you. 
And for the last 4 years, the department I work for, began to be sunset, and 
tho I knew I would loose my job, I supported you.  On Friday November 30, I 
issued the last State Building Permit, So now I have to try and find myself 
another job.  

Now that the position that I have done for the entire state has been done 
away with and a guy like myself will be required for each of the indivual 
counties and municipalities, I have found a job at Florida State University, 
where I will be able to continue to do what I have done, and bring with me 
what I have learned to a Dept. that does not have a clue as to the 
permitting and building inspection process.  I would like to ask if you 
would help me to obtain the position as building inspector for the States 
University Systems New Inspection and Permitting program.  

The person that is doing the hiring at FSU is Mr. Tom Deckert, who is FSU's 
New Building Code Administrator.  Mr. Deckerts Phone number is (850) 
644-7686, and his e-mail is: tdeckert@admin.fsu.edu. 

If it not to much, I would appreciate a vote of confidence from you to Mr. 
Deckert.  If I am out of line by asking this, and you would not feel right 
doing so, then that is no problem also.  

Reguardless of my future, be it with FSU or with another firm or agency, I 
assure you that I will continue to support you and back that promise up with 
my vote. 

May the Great God Bless you abundantly as he has myself.

TO:     Bill O'Reilly, O'Reilly Factor 
FROM:   Elizabeth Hirst,  Press Secretary for Governor Jeb Bush 
RE:     Previous Response to the O'Reilly Factor 


Please be advised that on October 16, 2001 the following information was 
provided to an associate producer in your office by the name of Andrea.  She 
called our press office to inquire about an interview with Governor Jeb Bush 
regarding the situation involving University of South Florida professor Sami 
Al-Arian.  The Governor was not available for an interview, however the 
following response was provided to Andrea. 

"No Governor in the state of Florida has ever had the authority to hire or 
fire university faculty, nor does the Governor have the authority to direct 
a university president to hire or fire any individual.  The university 
system in Florida is bound by a collective bargaining agreement.  In this 
case, Sami Al-Arian is a tenured professor. It is our understanding that 
under a legally binding contract, a person cannot be fired solely based on 
his/her beliefs or personal associations.  At this point, university 
officials are looking at all available options." 

The most appropriate contacts regarding this issue would be the President of 
the University of South Florida, Dr. Judy Genshaft, (813) 974-2791 SC 
574-2791 or the Secretary of the Florida Board of Education Jim Horne, 
850-201-7400.

Eli- 

Just a quick note to give my strong recommendation for the reappointment of 
Mary Jane Dillon to the Board for the Florida School for the Deaf and Blind. 

Mrs. Dillon has worked at Flagler College for the past four years, serving 
as Coordinator of Services for Students with Disabilities and as an 
Assistant to Dr. William Proctor, member of the Florida Board of Education. 
She comes highly recommended by Dr. Proctor as well.  In fact, he feels that 
she in an integral part of the Board and has made significant contributions 
to its success.  She comes with a wealth of knowledge. 

It is my understanding from Dr. Proctor that previous to her employment at 
the College, Mrs. Dillon worked at the Florida School for the Deaf and Blind

This is kind of a cool idea to have the Governor tape the "wake up message" used by the Hotel to start each guests day "in a special way."  
 
As the Gaylord Palms Resort folks note "Can you imagine getting a recorded message from the governor of Florida? I can't think of a more unique way to welcome our guests to the Sunshine State! "

A vote for a new tax 

 St. Petersburg Times, published December 6, 2001 


   As promised, the Legislature has voted to delay the previously approved intangibles tax cut, thereby saving $128-million to apply to the budget deficit. The margins of 37-2 in the Senate and 102-17 in the House were impressive, considering that it could be called -- as some did -- a vote for a new tax.   As promised, the Legislature has voted to delay the previously approved intangibles tax cut, thereby saving $128-million to apply to the budget deficit. The margins of 37-2 in the Senate and 102-17 in the House were impressive, considering that it could be called -- as some did -- a vote for a new tax.

   Now, that wasn't so hard, was it? 

   In debate, House members had to endure yet another of Mike Fasano's tiresome laments about the poor "savers" who have to pay a tax on their "hard-earned money after it's been taxed."

   Two things need to be said about that. 

   The bill came to the floor under a rule that prevented any amendments, among them a Democratic proposal to exempt more than 500,000 of the smallest taxpayers, double the rate on the rest and close a much-abused trust loophole. This would have virtually erased the deficit without any need for the punishing cuts in education, health and crime prevention that will occur under the budget bill to be passed today. It's a pity that the leadership didn't allow members to vote.

   Most people's life savings are concentrated in the value of their homes rather than in stocks and bonds subject to the intangibles tax. Yet Floridians pay real estate taxes on those homes, at an average of nearly 21 times the rate on stocks on bonds, without any comparable protest from Fasano. Might the fact that he works for a stock brokerage firm have something to do with his fixation?

Bush's tax cut wins delay despite several GOP nays 
By ALISA ULFERTS 
 St. Petersburg Times, published December 6, 2001 


   TALLAHASSEE -- Lawmakers handed Gov. Jeb Bush the delay he sought in a controversial tax cut Wednesday, but it came without the support of some of the House's most conservative members.   TALLAHASSEE -- Lawmakers handed Gov. Jeb Bush the delay he sought in a controversial tax cut Wednesday, but it came without the support of some of the House's most conservative members.

   Repeatedly, Bush has been asked whether he had the 61 Republican House votes he wanted to delay a cut in the state's intangibles tax. Repeatedly, he has answered "Absolutely" or "We have the votes."

   In the end, Bush got 60 Republicans to vote for the delay. Seventeen other GOP lawmakers defected. Had all 43 Democrats joined the 17 Republican defectors in opposing the bill, it would have failed. Now, it will go to Bush for his signature.

   Bush insisted he could have delivered more Republicans, if he needed them. 

   "We were up to about 68 votes -- 60 very solid and eight who would have joined us" had it not become clear that the Democrats were going to support the delay, Bush said.

   "We had a lot of 61st votes," Bush said. 

   The House's 102-17 vote marks the first time Bush has lost more than a handful of Republican votes on any issue he wanted. The Senate earlier had approved Bush's bill 36-2.

   Rep. Connie Mack was among the young conservatives, informally dubbed the Freedom Caucus, who opposed Bush's plan. 

   "There were some of us that had a philosophical belief that this was not the right thing to do or the right time to do it," said Mack, R-Fort Lauderdale. He doesn't think Bush's failure to get 61 Republican votes reflects on the governor's standing within his own party.

   "He's been a leader on tax cuts. This shouldn't be made into "The governor's changed on the position of taxes,' " Mack said.

   Democrats supported the tax delay, but not before rubbing Republicans' noses in that fact. Delaying the cut will free up $128-million so budget cuts in the special session won't be so deep.

   House Democratic Leader Lois Frankel said the Democrats had considered voting against the tax delay as a strategy to pressure the Republicans who run the House to back off the budget cuts further. But the Democrats decided that wouldn't work.

   "We thought all that would happen is one of the 17 (nay votes) would have the noose around his neck" by voting for the delay, Frankel said.

   Bush stepped in to help broker a budget deal after the first special session he called to fix the budget collapsed when Senate President John McKay and Speaker of the House Tom Feeney failed to agree on the intangibles tax. Part of that agreement -- to be finalized today -- was to delay the latest round of the intangibles tax cut for 18 months to give the economy time to recover.

   McKay had wanted to repeal the tax cut entirely, and Feeney wouldn't even consider a delay. 

   Feeney joined 16 other Republicans in voting against the compromise. But he asked his lieutenants to help round up votes for Bush's compromise plan.

   "I candidly never knew whether we had 61 votes or not, but I worked closely with some of the Democratic members," Feeney said.

   Rep. Mike Fasano, who has popularized the phrase "seniors and savers" during his speeches opposing the intangibles tax on stocks and bonds, said he was impressed by Bush's abilities to garner 102 votes, even though his wasn't among those.

   "I'm convinced that if 61 Republican votes were needed on the floor, there would have been 61 votes. But it probably would not have been mine," said Fasano, R-New Port Richey.

   It's a point Bush agrees with. 

   "We probably had six people who, if they were needed, would have helped, maybe more," Bush said. "It shows we can forge a consensus and deal with problems. It was a good day for Republican leadership ... and tomorrow will be an even better day."

Dear Governor Bush, 

We have just been made aware of some disturbing news...My son is one of the people who are on the Matter of Choice Project.  We entered into the Matter Of Choice Project in "Good Faith" that the program would be a testing program for Developmental Disabilities.  We risked losing our services in order to help Developmental Disabilities make their system more cost effective.  Now, we are being told that Developmental Disabilities has overspent more than $80 million (or some unGodly amount like that!).  It seems to me, you are asking our children to pay for something that obviously didn't have the proper  Checks and Balances System! 

We were originally told the project would be coming to an end as of June 2002.  Then, we were told the project would be coming to an end as of March 2002.  Last weekend, I attended a Family Care Council Chairperson's Meeting in Orlando and Mr. Carl Littlefield informed us the project would be ending in January 2002.  This evening, I just received a phone call from our FCC Chairperson informing us The Matter of Choice Program will be ending this Monday, Dec. 10th!!!  Which one is it?  How can we plan for our children's daily care if we can't even count on what we are told?  We can't help but feel as though we are being manipulated!!! 

We can't begin to plan for our children's daily care!!!  The dates keep changing...there is no time to look for any other sources, support coordinators, support services, transportation to jobs, day programs, etc.!!   

How can you take our services away when we haven't even been officially notified?  When were we going to be told?  We are lucky, we are informed because we are a part of the Family Care Council and so we know people who called us when this came down today, Wednesday!  What about the people who don't have the connections like us?  When would they find out?  Monday...when there would be no services?  No one would come for respite, daily care, transportation, job coaching...? 

Our children depend on these services for their daily living...to live in our communities as independent adults.  They want to be independent and lead productive lives just like any other person their age...these services allow that to happen!!  And now, they are being taken away without proper notice and without any explanations of other options! 

This is totally unfair and not being done in "Good Faith"!!!  We are very disappointed!!! 

Please show us and our children respect and give them their dignity!!  If the project must come to an end, give us proper notice and time to make the necessary adjustments!!  We need to be allowed back into the system in a timely manner in order to not disrupt our children's lives!!! 

I look forward to hearing from you on this matter! 

Sincerely, 

Joy Frazier, Parent 
Lyall L. Frazier III, Matter Of Choice Client

If not, can that test be used to grant a diploma equivalent to a regular high school diploma without the need for students to attend GED classes?  That would seem to be the perfect solution. 

Thank you for your consideration.

Subject:	Beware of that same old game... 

Governor - 

The same old semantical games have begun anew and will apparently be the 
focus of political and media attacks against you during your reelection bid. 
It's an old debating trick... rephrase and redefine - rephrase and redefine 
terminology and issues to place the argument into the best context from your 
point of view, regardless of accuracy. 

The results of the Special Session have yielded the first serious barrage of 
political and media bias in our newest political season.  And as the spin 
begins, the media either wittingly, or through sheer incompetence, is prone 
to further the arguments of the Democrats by repeating and echoing the false 
assertions... 

For example - a reduction in proposed budgetary growth is always cast by the 
Democrats and their media allies as a Spending Cut.  The implication is that 
key programs are being rolled-back, slashed, dismantled, etc.  The reality, 
as we both know, is that proposed increases in spending have been lowered - 
resulting in a lower level of new spending and growth, but still growth. 

This is not new and has been the hallmark of Democratic tactics for years. 
Reductions in taxation rates or taxation levels have always been 
characterized as Tax Cuts - even if the net result was an overall 
augmentation of tax revenue (as in the Reagan-Bush years).  They are more 
often clever ways to stimulate the economy and foster greater consumption 
and even greater government revenue.  But - the Democrats and the media are 
not going to redefine a tax-rate reduction as a tax revenue enhancer even if 
every living Nobel-winning Economist analyzed it that way on network TV. 

During the 2000 campaign, I tried to make this point again and again.  This 
is one big debate - and the Democrats and the media are jointly the 
opposition for the most part.  It is our role as Republicans to define, 
redefine and redefine again as necessary.  Our greatest challenge will 
always be "Rhetoric vs. Reality".  I've already heard Florida Republicans 
slip-up repeatedly over the last few weeks by agreeing to talk in 
"Demo-Speak", the language of our opposition.  If a Democrat labels a 
reduction in proposed spending increases as a Budget Cut - plain and simple, 
it is our responsibility to stop immediately and restate the obvious - 
redefining their rhetoric back into political reality.  If the media echoes 
Democratic remarks or frames questions in such terminology, we must likewise 
stop immediately and set the record straight.  Republicans far too often 
answer the question as is - even if it slanted or biased, even in its 
construction. 

It is a hard practice to master, and it requires extreme levels of self 
control and resolve... But it must be done.  "Right makes right" --- but it 
is far easier to be on the right side than it is to convince people of it. 
I have 20-30 personal examples of conversations where I have redefined media 
analysis of the results of the Special Session already.  And the results are 
always the same... "Oh, really? - well that makes since then."  But, if we 
don't explain it and redefine it as needed, we have already lost the battle 
of words. 

You can't be defeated in 2002 without political reality being spun into a 
"Demo-Speak" blur of contradictions and mis-information.  We already know 
that they are going to try... the only question is whether all Republicans 
are poised and ready to challenge them - with facts and truth and Republican 
realism. 

Good luck with all of this.  Your reelection is now my most pressing 
personal issue over the next 11 months.  If you or your team ever need any 
assistance, you only need ask... free-time, part-time or full-time... I'm 
ready to serve and assist as needed. 

Take care and God bless - Kevin Ward

Sir I am forwarding a copy of this quote to you, from former Governor Branstand, your recent appointee as chairman of the your Administrations new Special Education Commission.  It is people like him who give a major setback to the very little we have been able to achieve for our physically and mentally handicapped children, a large majority of the special education schools in this country are sorely lacking in what these children and adults need in just learning life skills to try and fit into what we call the "normal" world.  
A young lady I use to volunteer with who fell into the catagory of being physically and mentally handicapped was telling me that she referred to "normal" people as T.A.B.'s (Temporarilly  Able Bodied)  Because she said everybody at one time in their life is going to depend on someone else for total and complete help for just everyday living and God forbid that it be permenant like mine.  So to her everybody else in the "normal" world are just T.A.B.'s and if everybody could just see it that way they wouldn't think there investment in their education a waste of money.  A perfect example of this unfortunately if our former President Ronald Reagan.  I think this last statement says it all sir.    Right now in Florida we are in for the struggle of our lives due the cowardly act of terrorism perpitrated on our country and it's effect on our state and all the other fortynine states economy it may be because I am prejudiced but it seems like it is going to effect our handicapped children the most. Thank You for your time.

Dear Mr. Bush, 

   I remember coming to you with a plea for help.  I remember how stern and 
serious you took the meeting.  I remember you assigning someone to take care 
of the matter.  Well, here we are, nothing's changed other than DCF trying 
to cover its ass.  Let me give you a quick idea as to what I've lost during 
this ordeal: my truck, my job, my dignity, and my freedom.  I can't do this 
anymore.  Your agencies have blantently and provably broken the law, 
violated my rights & civil liberties, harbored an abusive individual and 
lied to cover it up in a swamp of paper work, broken promises and mis 
represented statements.  When the inspector general showed up at my house, 
his only concern was finding a fall guy in the matter; Delisa Mathews will 
be the target I'm sure.  When they dealt with Nancy and Al, it was purely a 
"prove DCF didn't relatiate" routine.  Now, when I talk to Sue Grey & 
BaryBeth on the matter, it's "we don't know anything" or "we can't tell you 
anything".  Well, tell me this Jeb, how is it that I've commited NO CRIME, 
I've done EVERYTHING that DCF has told me and I'm STILL paying for this??? 
No more.  I've waited long enough and sacrificed everything I can.  Is this 
the type of organization that runs the state I live in?  Well, it seems that 
my hands were bound 8 years ago when I was raped & they're still bound 
today.  I'm turning Charlie over to DCF as it's clear that I have no help in 
this matter and DCF has a state budget.  Personally, I hope you feel a 
little better knowing that an 8 year child can't be protected in your state 
because you don't have a clue as to what goes on behind your back.  As for 
me, I'll spend the next 5 or so years trying to recover what has taken me a 
lifetime to aquire and as for Charlie, all I can do is hope he makes it. 

Thanks for your help, 
John Greiner 

If you can't/won't help me, at least prevent this from happening to other 
innocent people.

Dear Governor Bush, 

Below is a copy of an email I am sending to our state legislators to thank them for protecting the funding for the developmentally disabled.  However,  we are all aware of the key role that you played in making sure that the proper action was taken to preserve the very livelihood of these special needs Floridians.   

The Family Care Council of District 7,  Orlando,  would just like to thank you again for your continued interest and support. 

Dean Parker, Co-Chair, 
Family Care Council,  District 7,  Orlando 

Dear Senator/Represetative, 

As advocates for the developmentally disabled, our most vulnerable Floridians,  our heartfelt thanks go out to you and your fellow legislators who took the time to take our phone calls,  read our emails, listen to us in face to face conversations, and then acted to preserve most of the funding that is so critical to this population.   

Responsible legislation of Florida's citizens tax contributions has moved our state to the forefront as a leader in caring for those who cannot care for themselves.  In one of the most trying budgeting sessions in memory,  you and your counterparts have withstood the pressures from many directions, and have determined those most needy and protected them.  For this we will forever be thankful.  As I am sure you understand,  we will continue to call on you as our elected officials to keep the developmentally disabled as a top priority when making funding decisions. 

Once again,  thanks so much for your support and you can depend on ours as we move into the future together. 

Respectfully, 


Dean Parker,  Co-Chair, 
Family Care Council,  District 7

Dear Jeb.....
It is my understanding that the mail order pilot program for diabetes for patients along the I-4 corridor (Central Florida) requires that patients receive their diabetic medications and supplies through an out of state provider Health Alliance.  Not only is that an outrage for businesses within this state but that it makes no sense at all medically.- it is dangerous to the patient.  Our pharmacy presently provides medication management for the Senior Resource Alliance which includes 5 counties in Central Florida.  We monitor not only their diabetes but also the diseases which are a direct result on non-compliance,  inappropriate use of medication, failure to properly educate, etc.  And- it is at no charge to anyone including the Medicaid program. There is no way to control the health of these people with the therapy bifurcated and with incomplete patient history at our pharmacy.   It is inconceivable that you would allow this to go to a company which up to this point has not performed in a satisfactory matter when you have a woman owned business in this state (and a staunch Republican member of the Republican Congressional Committee Business Advisory Council) right here in Central Florida (Orlando).  I understand that you will be in Orlando tomorrow and I would hope that you would have a few moments to speak with me as I have been invited by Rich Crotty to attend-as a member of OCREC.  Please e-mail me concerning this.  Thank you.

Dear Jeb,
 
Here is so more information about the A.B.L.E Center and the run around that Lori Bennett (if it's a real name) is
giving us. She used God's name for us to trust her. I now have a strong feeling that the all thing is a BIG scam.
I warned this morning Mary O'Meara from S.P.A.R.C in Volusia County who is hosting the A.B.L.E vision on
the 12th of this month, Mary told me that she was going to write to you too. 
Please, this is very important, can you have someone checking on this. 
I know that I have been asking help from you many times for our children, but if this is a group of Scientologists,
we need to find out and protec our angels.

When I open the website   http://www.able.org/index.htm   Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology is

Hello Lori,
 
Reading the first Email that was send to me. I saw that you were talking about oversees. Maybe you don't know but I am originally
from Europe. 
 

To briefly give a broad overview of the program:  The A.B.L.E. (Achieving Beyond Limited Expectations) Foundation, Inc. establishes, oversees, manages, and assists in the funding of each A.B.L.E. Center.  Strict quality control is essential to insure that our programs and services are provided in top-notch fashion.  The creation of each A.B.L.E. Center is simply a process of duplication.  The system has been developed and we are now ready to implement the creation of the Centers throughout the state in each community.  It is a very simple process to follow, but it does take commitment from the community and the families who will benefit from each Center.  So, if you are interested in helping to spear-head, so to speak, this project in YOUR community, please let us know as soon as possible.
 
so, I checkeed it up and found A.B.L.E International. that seems to be another wonderfull organization like yours.
that are helping people and I thought that you at least knew about it or maybe be part of A.B.L.E international.
You didn't tell me about NY and California I noticed. Could you please tell me?
 
God bless

Good evening Lori,
 
Thanks for your answers. It must be wonderful that you can volunteer all your time and that you are financially independent.
Right away, I can't have food or drinks inside the building in our local Library but it was nice of you to offer.
Where in NY and California do you have A.B.L.E Centers at various stages? I have friends and Family in those State too.
Are you associate with A.B.L.E  International?
Thanks again for answering my questions.
 
SIncerely
 
Beatrice

Hi Beatrice -
 
From reading your email, I can see why so many people are emailing me with compliments about you and your commitment to help people with disabilities!  You are busy gathering information and the people who can help make this awesome A.B.L.E. Vision a reality in Osceola County!
 
Great news about the meeting room.  We'll provide the refreshments.
 
We need to reach out to parents and families with children of all ages with disabilities - adults especially, too.  Encourage people to reach out to other people they have never really stopped to talk to.  Asking people if they have heard about the A.B.L.E. Vision and how it can benefit the community is a great way to get a conversation started.  
 
To answer your questions from your other email I received today:
 
We have A.B.L.E. Centers in various stages of opening in Illinois, California, Alabama, Georgia, and New York, so far with plans to open in all 50 states and Canada.
 
As a foundation, we are automatically a not-for-profit organization.  We are fully funded.  We are a group of philanthropists who are providing the seed money and the funding for this project.
 
We have the funding and will purchase the land the Centers will be built upon.
 
We have the funding to open the centers.  We need to make sure that the communities we choose to open a center in are able to keep it open.  Our concept is unique and it is not comparable to any other program currently open anywhere in this country serving people with disabilities.
 
We are volunteers in that we are financially independent and are able to volunteer our time without worrying about compensation.  
 
We are a private board of directors.  We do not solicit board members.
 
The A.B.L.E. Vision is a gift from God.
 
Our son, Daniel, who is 23 years old, is the inspiration for the A.B.L.E. Concept.
 
Our system works because it has taken more than 10 years to research, develop, and fine tune.  It is based upon success principles that are proven to be true.  We are here to serve, we are not self-seeking, nor do we seek fame or fortune.  We have no personal agendas - this is truly a gift from God - we are simply the vessles He is using.
 
As far as the actual buildings for the A.B.L.E. Center, we have architectural drawings of the A.B.L.E. Vision.  Approdx. 10-25 acres are necessary depending upon the needs of the communities we will be serving and the extent of the programs and services we will provide.
 
It is refreshing to see that you have questions and that you are thinking about this project in depth.  Ask any question you would like - that's perfectly fine!
 
Beatrice - you are doing a great job so far gathering informatin and people together and coordinating the meeting room and date and for getting the word out.  I saw the message on the hawke list today.  
 
We are open to questions, comments, and suggestions.  We are here to serve the needs of the community.  We are NOT funded by the government or any other agency - private or public.  We are free to dream big and to make those dreams a reality - together!
 
Keep doing what you are doing.  With the news about the state funding cutbacks, people are really getting desperate for help and for programs and services.  A.B.L.E. is the answer.
 
We are NOT affiliated in any way with the ABLE trust.  That is a state agency/organization.  Our name is a acronym for Achieving Beyond Limited Expectations.  
 
We can't wait to meet you and the dynamic Osceola group!
 
Warm regards,
Lori Bennett
Ambassador of Hope

FYI Several staff and faculty members in my department have stopped me in 
the hall today to express their outrage over Senator McKay's comments in the 
Gainesville Sun encouraging folks to take their shotguns into IFAS on a 
Friday after 4PM..  

1.  They resent the implication that IFAS folks do not work hard for their 
paychecks (and they are not aware that the Senator ever visited our building 
before making such a remark). 
2.  They feel that if any of them had made similar comments about the 
Florida Senate, that they would have been slammed into jail for threatening 
public officials carrying out their duties in a public building.  They want 
to know how anyone can get away with making such comments, especially in the 
wake of September 11th. 
3.  Several of the women who work on the first floor in my building  have 
said they now feel unsafe -- from crazies who might "take the hint" from 
McKay; I would not be surprized if some of my employees do take off this 
Friday and go home before 4PM. 

In the best of times, folks would be worried about losing their jobs; in 
these times of terrorism and other acts of public violence, this was an 
especially insensitive remark for a leading public official to make. 

Folks in my department have been pretty calm and fearless about all this 
budget-cut stuff -- they're pulling together, willing to endure the 
belt-tightening for the sake of the IFAS team, etc. (Several have inquired 
about the possibility of voluntary furloughs or going part time to prevent 
others from losing their jobs, etc.) But this latest cavalier comment from a 
key Florida legislator has REALLY ticked them off and contributed to a 
marked decline in morale. 

I know my staff and faculty are not alone in their feelings about this 
issue.  I assume other personnel in other departments are equally outraged.

Subject: Education -- State Diplomas


Dear Governor Bush: 

With more and more people choosing home school for their children, I would like to suggest a change in the Florida High School Diploma (GED) program.   Many of the home schoolers prescribe to a rigorous course of study yet they are only eligible for the GED Diploma, which to the best of my knowledge, can only be obtained by those under 18 by attending special GED classes.    The problem with this is twofold -- 1.) Many home schoolers curriculum is much more challenging than the GED classes and taking those are only a waste of time 2.) the General Studies Diploma only test for basic skills.   

My suggestion is that the state offer two different tests -- keep the General Education Diploma program with its study classes as is, and add a new test, for the more challenging curriculum and allow students 16 and older to take it so that they can continue their studies at colleges and universities when they are ready. 

Thank you for your consideration.

Dear Governor Bush, 
Last May I spoke with William Large about the shocking murder of a 
preborn infant, Baby 
Baez, by the hands of Florida abortionist (and convicted felon) James 
Scott Pendergraft. 

I reported the infant's murder to the Tampa Police Department on May 11, 
2001 
 I supplied them with all of the information that I am sending to you, 
including the name and telephone 
number of eye witness John Ruiz. The police did not follow up on the 
crime. 

I am so troubled by the lack of concern and justice in this infant murder 
case. I believe that it is my duty to little Baby Baez to pursue exposing 
this kind of murder. Below you will find information regarding the murder 
of Baby Baez. I would so appreciate your help at this time. Would you 
please follow up and make efforts to see to it that this case is brought 
to the attention of those in command of the criminal justice system in 
the state of Florida? 

I would be so grateful if you would take the time to read the case as I 
have outlined below 
and get the right people involved in investigating the horrible murder of 
Baby Baez. 

Blessings, 
Patte Smith 
Orlando 
407.830.8274 
******************************** 
The Central Florida Murder of Baby Baez 

Abortionist James Scott Pendergraft instructed his Orlando staff to have 
Ms Baez meet him at his Tampa abortuary (Hyde Park Women's Center, 502 
South Magnolia) on Friday, May 11, 2001. 
In the early evening (approximately 7 pm) of May 11, abortionist 
Pendergraft inserted a needle through the abdomen of Ms Baez , who was 
between 5-6 months pregnant. The syringe contained digoxin. Using 
ultrasound, Pendergraft guided the needle into the heart of Ms Baez's 
preborn baby girl and injected digoxin. The baby's heart sped up, then 
began to slow down, and finally the infant's tiny heart stopped beating. 
Abortionist Pendergraft gave Ms Baez pills with instructions to take them 
at midnight and then again at 6 a.m. The pills would induce Ms Baez's 
body into premature labor and eventual delivery of her stillborn infant. 

Ms Baez left Hyde Park Women's Center and checked into Economy Express 
Inn, West Kennedy Blvd, Rm 108 in Tampa with her cousin John Ruiz and 
three children. As instructed by abortionist Pendergraft, Ms Baez took 
the pills she was given at midnight. 

At 5a.m. on Saturday Ms Baez began her labor in earnest. Amidst her 
screams Ms Baez's baby girl was delivered on the bathroom floor of hotel 
room 108 by her cousin John Ruiz at 6 a.m. on the morning of Saturday, 
May 12, 2001. A frightened and bewildered John Ruiz was shocked to 
discover that the baby was fully developed with a head of soft hair. Ms 
Baez saw her infant laying on her side and was faced with the perfection 
and beauty of her little daughter. John Ruiz called Hyde Park Women's 
Center and was instructed NOT to call 911 or the local hospital. 
Pendergraft employee Inga advised that she would be right over to the 
hotel. With trembling hands John wrapped his tiny niece up in towels. 
When abortion clinic worker Inga arrived she looked at the baby and said: 
"I was afraid something like this would happen. When I got the emergency 
call this morning I knew it was you. If this baby had been just 2 weeks 
older she would've been considered a preemie." 

John Ruiz strapped his two children and Ms Baez's little boy into his 
van. He placed the tiny baby girl (who was bundled in towels from Economy 
Express) onto the floor of his van. Hyde Park Women's Center employee 
Inga drove ahead to the clinic in her own vehicle. As John raced to the 
abortuary he realized that Baby Baez's body rolled from side to side on 
the floor of the van. John slowed down to prevent her body from 
continuing to roll. 

When John Ruiz, Ms Baez and the four children arrived at Hyde Park 
Women's Center, employee Inga advised John to place Baby Baez on the 
counter in the back of the abortuary. Pendergraft employee Inga proceeded 
to become physically ill, vomiting several times in an office of the 
abortuary. After Pendergraft employee Inga took some time to recover she 
proceeded to provide some kind of medical care to Ms Baez. 

John Ruiz took Ms Baez  and the three children back home to Orlando on 
the morning of May 12, 2001. 

Did Dr James Scott Pendergraft commit an illegal abortion in this case? 
What happened to the body of Baby Baez? 
Why didn't the Tampa Police investigate? 

This infanticide was reported as a murder to Tampa Police Department on 
the afternoon of May 12, 2001by Patte Smith of Orlando (407.830.8274). 
Baby Baez case number: 01-34976 
To my knowledge the body of Baby Baez was not seized by the TPD, nor was 
a 
thorough criminal investigation performed. 

John Ruiz is willing to cooperate fully in the 
investigation of this murder. 
To investigate this story please call John Ruiz: 407.238.9074 

FTI: The abortionist (and abortion clinic owner) who performed the murder 
of Baby Baez, James Scott Pendergraft, is presently serving a 46 month 
sentence in for unrelated charges (extortion). He began serving his 
sentence in August. He is in Federal Prison Camp in Atlanta. His 
registration # is 42979-018. The telephone number of the prison is 
407-635-5100.

Dear Governor; Thank you for sending the staff from fish 
& wild life & DEP to our NOV 6, 2001 meeting for WHOA. 
The gentlemen were very nice, and started off seemingly 
objective, but as the meeting progressed they talked 
themselves out of doing anything different. And then 
told us "we should be happy with the status quo". We 
have held 2 workshops & meetings since then, and our 
participants overwhelmingly found each time, the status 
quo, unacceptable. We have strong beliefs that there is 
a more economical, effective way to clean up our lake, 
from this constant mess of weeds and muck. We don't like 
hearing "this new program (essentially the same process) 
will take 4-5 yrs to implement", or putting the blame on 
some other condition, while we feel they are just 
putting us of until they can retire. It is felt they are 
being well paid to do a job, that falls far from success 
in resolving our problem. We have some suggestions that 
deserve to be heard, and possibly tried, and are willing 
to bring our staff to the capital for a presentation, if 
necessary. But we certainly need a change of direction, 
that will yield RESULTS.I'm writing you this letter on 
behalf of our WHOA participants at our meeting this PM. 
Regards Stuart Barnette Director of WHOA 
PS We like all of your other accomplishment.

i want to bring to your attention to the direction (what i know is mostly rumor) that the p rule is heading.   dep had some meetings (operated by some consultants) with "interested parties" and many presentations were made and there was lots of discussion.  
 
we (wellington) had requested one more meeting for everyone to describe what technology (s) could bring us to standard,  but that did not happen.   
 
it seems that we are heading for a standard of 10 (wellington is not really interested in arguing this) and how the standard is measured (and wellington has no choice but to be interested in this aspect)  we made a presentation to the consultants and other parties and brought forward all the unresolved issues that have an impact on the urban areas (such things as by-pass water, where and how to measure, stuff like that) and what seems to be coming out is a system of "variances" which i believe will cause major heartburn.
 
i think dep as labored hard on this issue and doing everything i can do to make sure we do not embrace you or ourselves in the process............................   somehow i think this one ends up on your desk.

Dear Mr. Bush, 

   I remember coming to you with a plea for help.  I remember how stern and 
serious you took the meeting.  I remember you assigning someone to take care 
of the matter.  Well, here we are, nothing's changed other than DCF trying 
to cover its ass.  Let me give you a quick idea as to what I've lost during 
this ordeal: my truck, my job, my dignity, and my freedom.  I can't do this 
anymore.  Your agencies have blantently and provably broken the law, 
violated my rights & civil liberties, harbored an abusive individual and 
lied to cover it up in a swamp of paper work, broken promises and mis 
represented statements.  When the inspector general showed up at my house, 
his only concern was finding a fall guy in the matter; Delisa Mathews will 
be the target I'm sure.  When they dealt with Nancy and Al, it was purely a 
"prove DCF didn't relatiate" routine.  Now, when I talk to Sue Grey & 
BaryBeth on the matter, it's "we don't know anything" or "we can't tell you 
anything".  Well, tell me this Jeb, how is it that I've commited NO CRIME, 
I've done EVERYTHING that DCF has told me and I'm STILL paying for this??? 
No more.  I've waited long enough and sacrificed everything I can.  Is this 
the type of organization that runs the state I live in?  Well, it seems that 
my hands were bound 8 years ago when I was raped & they're still bound 
today.  I'm turning Charlie over to DCF as it's clear that I have no help in 
this matter and DCF has a state budget.  Personally, I hope you feel a 
little better knowing that an 8 year child can't be protected in your state 
because you don't have a clue as to what goes on behind your back.  As for 
me, I'll spend the next 5 or so years trying to recover what has taken me a 
lifetime to aquire and as for Charlie, all I can do is hope he makes it. 

Thanks for your help, 
John Greiner 

If you can't/won't help me, at least prevent this from happening to other 
innocent people.

Subject: MAIL ORDER PILOT PROGRAM FOR DIABETES


Dear Jeb.....
It is my understanding that the mail order pilot program for diabetes for patients along the I-4 corridor (Central Florida) requires that patients receive their diabetic medications and supplies through an out of state provider Health Alliance.  Not only is that an outrage for businesses within this state but that it makes no sense at all medically.- it is dangerous to the patient.  Our pharmacy presently provides medication management for the Senior Resource Alliance which includes 5 counties in Central Florida.  We monitor not only their diabetes but also the diseases which are a direct result on non-compliance,  inappropriate use of medication, failure to properly educate, etc.  And- it is at no charge to anyone including the Medicaid program. There is no way to control the health of these people with the therapy bifurcated and with incomplete patient history at our pharmacy.   It is inconceivable that you would allow this to go to a company which up to this point has not performed in a satisfactory matter when you have a woman owned business in this state (and a staunch Republican member of the Republican Congressional Committee Business Advisory Council) right here in Central Florida (Orlando).  I understand that you will be in Orlando tomorrow and I would hope that you would have a few moments to speak with me as I have been invited by Rich Crotty to attend-as a member of OCREC.  Please e-mail me concerning this.  Thank you.

Governor Bush, 

It was so nice to see you yesterday at Disney MGM. It was an honor to have 
you on our property boosting morale for our community and State. You really 
have done an amazing job during this time of crisis. It is comforting to 
know we have such an integral leader running the State of Florida. 
What I am really writing you about is to thank you for acknowledging Jos 
and I yesterday in front of the Big Cheese! Not only was it nice to talk to 
you, it was nice that Michael, Paul, Roy, and Bob were all standing by! I'm 
sure they were all like "who the heck are these people" but who cares, they 
saw you talking to me--which, I think says a lot. Thank you for being a good 
friend, Governor. 
I hope you are able to send me the picture of us you took yesterday on your 
camera via email. I may have to take my Doak Campbell Stadium screen saver 
off and replace it with our photo. :-) 

I hope you and your family have a joyous holiday season. Take care, Governor 
and thank you for all of the hard work you continue to do for our State!

Governor - 

I think that you are right on target with your new tourism initiatives.  To 
me, FLA-USA stands for FLORIDA --- "Unlimited State Appeal".  It's appeal is 
UNIQUE as well, but I think it's more accurate to say - UNLIMITED. 

Our family in fact had two week-long vacations this year and both were 
within Florida.  I've now been to 33 different countries and over 40 states, 
but I find that Florida itself offers more than enough variety, 
entertainment and sheer vacation value.  It's like multiple states & nations 
all rolled into one. 

Except for the Inaugural Ball back in January, the next Bush Inaugural to 
come - and your two future Inaugurals... I can't think of a really good 
reason to travel beyond our borders.  *** I actually wouldn't mind making it 
to the "Rose Bowl" (since the Canes have been my favorite team since the 
days of Jim Kelley), but tickets to that one aren't likely and Pasadena is 
just too far... 

This is exactly why I was so keen on that Florida Film Commissioner or 
Deputy Commissioner opportunity... there's just no other place on Earth like 
FLA-USA... Florida has it all and moreover - it can appear on film like 
anywhere you ever would want to or need to go... 

Please keep up the effective cheerleading on Florida's behalf and keep us 
all on the right track.  Florida will rebound soon and stronger than ever.  

Take care -

Dear Jeb, 
Hope all is well with you and your family.  Thank you for the consideration 
you have given to autism and the entire DD population in the special session 
and the budget crisis.  Your influence and leadership have not gone 
unnoticed. 

We have been trying to amass local dollars, both public and private, to fund 
programs for children that will suffer i.e. child care and summer programs, 
extended school year, etc.  Now is a perfect opportunity to encourage the 
local community leadership to fill in the gaps for those programs that have 
experienced cuts. 

The good new is property values are at an all time high in Broward and we 
have a new children's taxing district.   Bad news is the new council and the 
county commission feel that if they step up to the plate and fund lost 
dollars, the state will abandon their responsibility, when it is in a 
position to fund. 

Efforts have been initiated to bring their attention to these pressing 
concerns and hopefully we will be successful. The disabled population is not 
represented on the council and, as I predicted, have been left out of the 
mix. Our highly successful Inclusive Childcare Project is in trouble.  Since 
there is no special needs catagory, we structured a request around their 
guidlines in the abused and neglected category (which many become), they 
then informed us they would not accept lost dollar applications.  We have 
over 350 children in this program and a waiting list.  Your support for this 
effort with the Children's Services Council here in Broward would be greatly 
appreciated. 

Unfortunately, some have the feeling that dollars would be better spent on 
children that are not so "hopeless" and can transition into the community.  
Disabled children through no fault of their own are not being treated 
equitably in this process. 

Which brings me to this quote I wanted you to see that offended many parents 
who have fought so long in education and have the same hopes and dreams for 
their children as everyone else. 
********************************************************************** 
Quote from Chair of President Bush's Commission on Special 
Education 

Gov. Branstad (former governor of Iowa) has been appointed to serve as 
chair of the Administration's new special education commission. 

Following is a quote from Gov Branstad (Iowa) from an interview 
transcript. The entire transcript is available at: 

http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/education/schools_1-16.html 

GOV. TERRY BRANSTAD: In our state nearly 60 percent of the budget goes 
for education. And what we find is people are willing to invest in 
quality education, but they are also fiscally conservative. They want to 
see results. They want to see achievement for the dollars that they put 
in. I think that the federal government in its mandates in the area of 
special ed has driven up costs needlessly. I think that needs to be 
reviewed. 

I want to see every child have an opportunity to learn. All special 
ed children do have a right to an education, but to spend tens 
oft thousands of dollars on kids that really are not going to be able to 
support themselves or be able to really learn a great deal at the 
expense of the general education of the rest of the students is not 
fair. 

And so that has to be addressed. A lot of people are afraid of it, 
of being, you know, accused of being insensitive or whatever. I was 
in Sioux City, Iowa, yesterday, and I heard from a Teacher of the Year, 
Nancy Mounts, who had been Teacher of the Year, and the 
superintendent there about how their school is being squeezed 
because of the federal mandates in the area of special ed and 
how there needs to be more flexibility and latitude given to local 
school districts in that area. 

******************************************************************** 


Jeb, if you ever cross paths with Governor Branstad, maybe you could mention 
that all children can learn and although many do not learn through 
traditional methods, no child should be left behind.  They should never be 
penalized or treated as damaged goods with no hope or potential. 

A sincere and heartfelt "Thank You" for all you do and for your past 
support.  You have my undaunted support and commitment for your re-election. 
  Please let me know what I can do to help you here in Broward. 
Good Luck and have a blessed holiday! 

Susan

Subject: New Ocala Star-Banner response



Gobernador, 

We have prepared the following extended outline for a new response to the 
Ocala Star-Banner Editorial. 


        These would be the themes for each paragraph: 

        a) Same intro: Your November 25 editorial, "On the backs of the 
vulnerable," does not paint n accurate picture of how we are striving to 
preserve essential services to our people despite the need to cut our budget 
for this fiscal year. 

        b) We are faced with tough choices, but by abiding by our 
principles, the legislators have done an outsanding job at protecting the 
budgets for our schools and for the services we provide to Florida's most 
vulnerable. Examples: our schools saw their budgets cut by only a fraction 
of the amount originally projected, from XX% to only XX% (other examples if 
available) 

        c)  However, It is important to remember that FL's budget is still 
growing and that even with the cuts made this session, we are still 
providing better services to more Floridians than at any other time in 
recent history. Economic development and tax cuts are more important today 
than ever before because they not only stimulate growth, but also help us 
fund Florida's priorities. 

        d) Thanks to the Legislature, Florida has today a balanced budget 
and enough money to stimulate its economy and protect its citizens. These 
are no small achievements, especially during a time when our nation is at 
war and we are experiencing an economic downturn.  

Please let us know if this a better approach, sir, so that we can beign to 
draft it. 

Thank you,

Dear Governor Bush, 

Below is a copy of an email I am sending to our state legislators to thank them for protecting the funding for the developmentally disabled.  However,  we are all aware of the key role that you played in making sure that the proper action was taken to preserve the very livelihood of these special needs Floridians.

Dear Senator/Represetative, 

As advocates for the developmentally disabled, our most vulnerable Floridians,  our heartfelt thanks go out to you and your fellow legislators who took the time to take our phone calls,  read our emails, listen to us in face to face conversations, and then acted to preserve most of the funding that is so critical to this population.   

Responsible legislation of Florida's citizens tax contributions has moved our state to the forefront as a leader in caring for those who cannot care for themselves.  In one of the most trying budgeting sessions in memory,  you and your counterparts have withstood the pressures from many directions, and have determined those most needy and protected them.  For this we will forever be thankful.  As I am sure you understand,  we will continue to call on you as our elected officials to keep the developmentally disabled as a top priority when making funding decisions. 

Once again,  thanks so much for your support and you can depend on ours as we move into the future together.

Then later, when you went into office, you allowed me to bring my boy and

modifications to the career service system, I sent you a letter that I 
backed you and you sent it back to me, with your signature and a thank you. 
And for the last 4 years, the department I work for, began to be sunset, and 
tho I knew I would loose my job, I supported you.  On Friday November 30, I 
issued the last State Building Permit, So now I have to try and find myself 
another job.  

Now that the position that I have done for the entire state has been done 
away with and a guy like myself will be required for each of the indivual 
counties and municipalities, I have found a job at Florida State University, 
where I will be able to continue to do what I have done, and bring with me 
what I have learned to a Dept. that does not have a clue as to the 
permitting and building inspection process.  I would like to ask if you 
would help me to obtain the position as building inspector for the States

If it not to much, I would appreciate a vote of confidence from you to Mr. 
Deckert.  If I am out of line by asking this, and you would not feel right 
doing so, then that is no problem also.  

Reguardless of my future, be it with FSU or with another firm or agency, I

Governor, 
You may recall suspending Mr. Brown after he was charged with sexual battery 
and aggravated battery (both felonies) for attacking his girlfriend in 
January.  He was the man that shoved dirt down the victim's throat and 
digitally penetrated the victim's vagina.  The State Attorney's Office 
accepted a plea to a misdemeanor battery charge in July, but you agreed to 
leave the suspension order in effect based on our belief that Mr. Brown had, 
in fact, committed a felony.  (As you know, you can suspend county officers 
if they commit a felony but not if they commit a misdemeanor.)  Wendy and I 
were prepared for a trial on Monday, held before the Senate's special 
master,  to prove the felony charges and get Mr. Brown permanently removed 
from office.  

Today, Mr. Brown resigned his position.  He recently got a copy of all the 
evidence that Wendy and I planned to present, and many people (including the 
victim) received subpoenas this week for the trial.  I believe he finally 
realized the strength of our case and decided not to have all the dirty 
laundry aired at a public trial.  On your behalf, we filed an Executive 
Order today officially declaring his seat vacant. 

The State Attorney's Office has asked local law enforcement to make extra 
patrols by the residence of Mr. Brown and the victim to respond to any 
domestic violence that might arise from the resignation.  One of the reasons 
the victim did not want to cooperate was because of Mr. Brown's position as 
a County Commissioner.  If there is more violence, perhaps she will be more 
likely to cooperate since he is no longer a County Commissioner.

Jeb,

Please give me a hand with this.  Back in the beginning of the summer I asked you for some PR Quotes that we could use for Microsoft's, Cisco's, etc Press Releases on American Education Association and how it is a win win for Children, Parents, Teachers, Schools, and America. You said (something to the effect of), sure and forwarded the information and a note from you to John Winn. 

I never heard from John even though I send him a couple of emails as a follow up (I waited about 2 weeks before I sent anything to him) Eventually I heard from Colleen Castille. Colleen was enthusiastic and said that she would get some wordage from you, education, and several other people. That never happened. I spoke to her on the phone, I have had an ongoing email dialog with her (once every 6 weeks or so) including about 2 weeks ago.

When we last corresponded she was now negative and wasn't sure if she could do anything. I ask her if she would like a copy of the email that you sent to me and copied to John Winn and she said no.

I know this is long winded but could you please intervene with a quick note to someone. We are launching and will be heading for Florida in the first quarter of next year.

Gov. Bush,

Please confirm that you received my correspondence regarding the new adoption law, which I sent to you a couple of days ago.

I'm sure it takes you a while to get to non-urgent matters, I just want to make sure you received it and it's on your list of things to do.

Thanks.

Hi Governor Bush,  I know that you have been very busy lately with everything that is happening in the countrry. I saw in the paper yesterday that you were with the President down in Orlando. We want you to know that we are supporting all of your efforts and believe you are both doing a great job under very difficult circumstances. I am going to try to forward a song that a friend sent me. It is a song by Alan Jackson with beautiful pictures. If you have not seen it, you may like to.  Teresa Young

considered strong, the others if needed.  Once the dems made it clear they

DEP 
. Bruce Ritchie, Tallahassee Democrat, re: interviewing Sec. Struhs. Scaled 
back the time needed considerably -- approximately 1 hour -- but still wants 
that 1/2 day w/ the photographer. Claims he wants to do a profile story, but 
when I asked for specific questions he had none. He said topics of interest 
are: Increased enforcement activity (specifically St. Mark's refinery -- of 
which he was critical); ACF; DEPs enforcement record; Mary Jean Yon and 
problems in Escambia.  Told him that I would pass this information along and 
get back with him if scheduling an interview is possible. However, told him 
that IF we agreed to this interview at all, the MOST he would get is a half 
hour and it's no dice with the photog.

re: 
arsenic-contaminated drinking water wells.Why has DEP offered assistance to 
connect Wimberly Estates (Gainesville)residences to GRU public water system?

summary: 
I explained that since EPA has decided to reduce the drinking water standard 
for arsenic from 50 ppb to 10 ppb, we decided to proceed with assisting the 
Wimberly Estates residents that have drinking water wells containing more 
than 10 ppb arsenic. I said that once the residents return our applications 
for assistance, the purchase order for the connections could be issued to 
GRU 
within a few days, but I was uncertain how long it would take for GRU to 
construct the water line extension and install the water meters.

Dear Governor Bush: 


We are writing to you in keeping with a discussion that we had in your 
office last year.  We had met with you regarding the process of implementing 
community-based care, and you had requested at that time that we let you 
know of issues that needed to be addressed to keep the implementation on 
track. 

An extremely important issue has come to our attention as we move forward 
with implementing comunity-based care projects in additional communities 
(Daytona Beach, Tampa, Pensacola and Palm Beach).  Private providers are 
currently being required to secure a performance bond equal to 25% of the 
community-based care contracts.  There are a number of detrimental impacts 
of this requrement.  They include: 

        1.  The costs of securing the bond.   The lead agencies are being 
asked to secure and pay for the bonds.  The cost of the bonds is 
approximately $15 per $1,000 of coverage, which would create $1.5 million of 
costs being diverted from service provision (based on $400 million) of CBC 
contracts. 

        2.  Many CBC systems are being developed using separately 
incorporated entities.  They are unable to secure the performance bonds and 
the bonds are only attainable when a third party provides a guarantee for 
the bond.  The bonding companies are requiring guarantees from 
community-based agencies against their limited assets. 

        3.  With agency assets pledged against the bonds we are concerned 
about the mpact on our ability to continue to raise funds privately if a 
donor feels that their contribution could be lost. 

While we understand the state's need for some form of protection against the 
default of the CBC initiative, the current requirements will dramatically 
limit the ability of community-based agencies to assume the lead agency 
role.  Strong participation of experienced community-based agencies is 
essential to successfully complete the vision of community-based care. 

We would be happy to meet with you or a member of your staff to discuss this 
issue further. 

Thank you very much for your attention to this matter.

We understand that Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison has called you.
 
She wants to talk to you about TANF supplemental grants.  Hutchison and Graham are the original sponsors of this legislation and have pushed hard in the Senate----they got it through Committee and now want to get it on the Senate calendar.  Senator Lott has a hold on the bill and wont let it come up for a vote.  Senator Hutchison will ask you to call Senator Lott and ask him to remove the hold.  
 
This one yr extension of TANF supplemental grants will provide an additional $60 million to Florida; suggested talking points:
 
*	I understand that Governor Huckabee (R-Ark) is placing a call to Senator Lott with a request to lift the hold.
*	Huckabee will impress on him how important these supplemental grants are to southern Republican governors.
*	I hope to speak with Chairman Young to ask his help in adding this provision in either the Labor/HHS or DOD conference.
 
Note:  We can follow-up with Chairman Youngs staff.  The Administration did not include TANF supplemental grants in their 02 budget and at this point were not sure how or if theyll include it in 03.  
 
Pls let me know if you speak with Senator Hutchison.  Nina.

As we have previously discussed with your staff, an important priority for the 
President is that Congress grant him Trade Promotion Authority (TPA).  The House 
will vote tomorrow on H.R. 3005 -- Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 
2001, sponsored by Rep. Thomas (R-CA).  If you feel it appropriate, the 
following House members may appreciate a reminder that you support TPA for the 
President.  Attached are talking points on TPA.  Please let us know of any

Subject:	New Ocala Star-Banner response

Gobernador, 

We have prepared the following extended outline for a new response to the 
Ocala Star-Banner Editorial. 


        These would be the themes for each paragraph: 

        a) Same intro: Your November 25 editorial, "On the backs of the 
vulnerable," does not paint n accurate picture of how we are striving to 
preserve essential services to our people despite the need to cut our budget 
for this fiscal year. 

        b) We are faced with tough choices, but by abiding by our 
principles, the legislators have done an outsanding job at protecting the 
budgets for our schools and for the services we provide to Florida's most 
vulnerable. Examples: our schools saw their budgets cut by only a fraction 
of the amount originally projected, from XX% to only XX% (other examples if 
available) 

        c)  However, It is important to remember that FL's budget is still 
growing and that even with the cuts made this session, we are still 
providing better services to more Floridians than at any other time in 
recent history. Economic development and tax cuts are more important today 
than ever before because they not only stimulate growth, but also help us 
fund Florida's priorities. 

        d) Thanks to the Legislature, Florida has today a balanced budget 
and enough money to stimulate its economy and protect its citizens. These 
are no small achievements, especially during a time when our nation is at 
war and we are experiencing an economic downturn.  

Please let us know if this a better approach, sir, so that we can beign to 
draft it. 

Thank you,

Governor Bush, 

I am the guy who back before you ran for office, sent you a letter, that I 
supported you, I believed in you and when the day came, I voted for you. 
Then later, when you went into office, you allowed me to bring my boy and 
wife over and have our picture taken.  When you implimented making 
modifications to the career service system, I sent you a letter that I 
backed you and you sent it back to me, with your signature and a thank you. 
And for the last 4 years, the department I work for, began to be sunset, and 
tho I knew I would loose my job, I supported you.  On Friday November 30, I 
issued the last State Building Permit, So now I have to try and find myself 
another job.  

Now that the position that I have done for the entire state has been done 
away with and a guy like myself will be required for each of the indivual 
counties and municipalities, I have found a job at Florida State University, 
where I will be able to continue to do what I have done, and bring with me 
what I have learned to a Dept. that does not have a clue as to the 
permitting and building inspection process.  I would like to ask if you 
would help me to obtain the position as building inspector for the States 
University Systems New Inspection and Permitting program.  

The person that is doing the hiring at FSU is Mr. Tom Deckert, who is FSU's 
New Building Code Administrator.  Mr. Deckerts Phone number is (850) 
644-7686, and his e-mail is: tdeckert@admin.fsu.edu. 

If it not to much, I would appreciate a vote of confidence from you to Mr. 
Deckert.  If I am out of line by asking this, and you would not feel right 
doing so, then that is no problem also.  

Reguardless of my future, be it with FSU or with another firm or agency, I 
assure you that I will continue to support you and back that promise up with 
my vote. 

May the Great God Bless you abundantly as he has myself.

I understand you have a phone call schedule for Friday morning with Mike

I have shared with no one the idea that you and Donna and I have discussed. 
Friday's call, in my opinion, is not the right time or place to present that 
strategy.  I think Donna and I need to first meet with some key legislative 
leaders. 

Do you want anyone from DEP or OPB to join you for Friday's call? 

Finally, do not be surprised if Mike raises issue of the phosphorous 
criteria.  The water management district governing board members are feeling 
a little out of the loop on this.  Our focus has been working with the ERC 
and the agriculture and environmental interests. I am spending several hours 
with Ken Wright today.  We also spent a day with water management district 
staff yesterday and previously spent a full day with Henry Dean....  Time has 
not allowed us to keep the governing board members engaged.  We are also 
trying to manage how our proposal is refined and how it ultimately emerges. 
This requires some limits on the numbers of cooks in the kitchen.

Subject:	Win of Removal Action against Avant Brown, Glades County Commissioner

Governor, 
You may recall suspending Mr. Brown after he was charged with sexual battery 
and aggravated battery (both felonies) for attacking his girlfriend in 
January.  He was the man that shoved dirt down the victim's throat and 
digitally penetrated the victim's vagina.  The State Attorney's Office 
accepted a plea to a misdemeanor battery charge in July, but you agreed to 
leave the suspension order in effect based on our belief that Mr. Brown had, 
in fact, committed a felony.  (As you know, you can suspend county officers 
if they commit a felony but not if they commit a misdemeanor.)  Wendy and I 
were prepared for a trial on Monday, held before the Senate's special 
master,  to prove the felony charges and get Mr. Brown permanently removed 
from office.  

Today, Mr. Brown resigned his position.  He recently got a copy of all the 
evidence that Wendy and I planned to present, and many people (including the 
victim) received subpoenas this week for the trial.  I believe he finally 
realized the strength of our case and decided not to have all the dirty 
laundry aired at a public trial.  On your behalf, we filed an Executive 
Order today officially declaring his seat vacant. 

The State Attorney's Office has asked local law enforcement to make extra 
patrols by the residence of Mr. Brown and the victim to respond to any 
domestic violence that might arise from the resignation.  One of the reasons 
the victim did not want to cooperate was because of Mr. Brown's position as 
a County Commissioner.  If there is more violence, perhaps she will be more 
likely to cooperate since he is no longer a County Commissioner.

Per our Driver License Strategic Plan filed with the Florida Department of

strengthen domestic security is to begin limiting the duration of driver 
licenses to the duration of pertinent Immigration and Naturalization Service 
documents.  

The computer software modifications we began in mid-November to accomplish 
this procedural change have just been completed.  The first test of this 
rollout began yesterday at our Pembroke Pines driver license office and all 
went well.  We will phase-in all other driver license offices over the next

Dear Jeb, 

I have been following the tourism issue concerning our State lately. I am 
holding quite a few events through out the state of FL. this month. These 
particular events we call "Christmas Events or Christmas Dinners." These 
events range from 200 to 2,000 people. Most that attend these events are from 
out of state. My events start from the 7th of December thru the last weekend 
of December (not on Christmas of course). A single event starts on a Friday 
and runs till Sunday. People start coming in on a Thursday - this gives them 
lots of time to visit the local attractions. We normally hold these events at 
nice resorts in the areas that we are holding the event at. I believe that by 
bringing in these number of "out-of-state" people will help. I will speak at 
these events promoting tourism in the state of FL. Here are some of the areas 
we will be in.

tourism efforts now more than ever--if nothing else to support the ideals 
that VISIT FLORIDA is tasked to accomplish. 

As you know, the Tourism Commission, which directs VISIT FLORIDA and its 
marketing efforts is led by a diverse group tourism industry leaders (from 
local CVBs to senior private sector execs).  The marketing committee is led 
by the VP of Seaworld for Marketing.  As well, the Chair of VISIT FLORIDA is 
the head of marketing for Universal Studios and President of Travel Industry 
Association of America.  They support the Fahlgren Agency and the work that 
they have done to date.  However, please note, that did not stop them from 
conducting, and just completing, a RFP for ad/mktg firms.  They do this 
annually.  I believe Fahlgren was the selected proposal, but they were 
definately not a shoe-in. 

While I recognize your frustration with what you note as bureacracy, I would 
hope that you support the Governor's tourism leadership message and efforts 
to get Florida back on track.  Respectfully said, it should not be about 
Fahlgren, but about all of us and what can we do to make a difference to the 
state--whether with VISIT FLORIDA or not. 

Please know you are always welcome to contact me where and when needed. 

Respectfully, 

Pam

bureaucracy." 


Dear Pamella Dana: 

   As you may recall, my agency has expended considerable effort and time 
attempting to help the State of Florida jumpstart its tourism business. 

   Results: 0. 

   While our ideas have been warmly embraced by the marketing staff at 
FLAUSA, we have encountered the sternest and stiffest bureaucratic 
resistance imaginable from the higher-ups, who apparently don't want to be 
bothered with anyone or anything that might possibly upset the status quo. 

   Yesterday in Orlando, President Bush said, "I hate the bureaucracy."  He 
was referring to the plight of a small businessman whose SBA application had 
gotten lost in the quagmire of Washington red tape.  That quagmire exists 
everywhere, including Tallahassee. 

    Elected representatives are keenly sensitive to the needs and opinions 
of their constituents.  Appointed officials less so.  Tenured bureaucrats 
hardly at all.  The latter are concerned primarily with their own 
perquisites, powers, protocols, procedural niceties and personal position in 
the political pecking order. 

   Sadly, there is really only one effective way to influence any 
bureaucracy - other than appeal directly in person, on-air, to The President 
of The United States. 

   Tomorrow morning we email and mail the following to every newspaper, wire 
service, radio & TV news department in Florida.  Since you have been 
reasonably up and up with me, I'm giving you the courtesy of a first FYI: 

_______ 

Anyone in who works in Florida's tourism industry should know that the 
$20,000,000  emergency marketing fund voted on yesterday by the legislature 
may or may not  be spent on ads that actually bring tourists to Florida.  It 
all depends... 

According to the marketing department of FLAUSA, the quasi-governmental 
marketing co-coordinator for the Department of Tourism, every dollar in 
state funds must be matched by a dollar or more in corporate funds. 

So the state's agency of record, Fahlgren & Geiger in Tampa, must first sell 
their creative ideas to co-op sponsors such as Holiday Inns, Budget Rent a 
Car, and Delta Airlines.  If Fahlgren is successful they, and they alone, 
get $20 million + $20 million in windfall billings. 

But what if corporate sponsors are tapped out?  What if they don't 
particularly care for Fahlgren's jingles or TV spots?  Then nothing could 
happen.  According to FLAUSA's rules, no other marketing, advertising and 
promotional firms are allowed to contact, present ideas to, and solicit 
co-op funding from anyone on Fahlgren's proprietary list of corporate 
contacts. 

Fahlgren won the state's business fair and square - during peacetime when 
tourism was booming and just about any ad could get people to fly or drive 
here.  Today we're in a war and a recession.  The stakes are huge.  There's 
no guarantee that Fahlgren can attract $20,000,000 in co-op dollars, or that 
their ideas, and theirs alone, will motivate terrified tourists in Georgia, 
New York to Toronto to come back to Florida. 

Florida can't afford to bet its entire tourism industry on one ad agency. 

The Department of Tourism should immediately issue an RFP to all ad agencies 
and marketing firms in the state; invite everyone to Tallahassee in 30 days; 
give everyone a chance to pitch their ideas to all the corporate marketing 
directors and tourism officials - all at once. 

We want tourists to vote for Florida's best with their dollars.  Why 
shouldn't't corporate sponsors be given the same opportunity? 

_______ 

    Do I expect anything good to come out of this for The Burkhard Agency? 
Not really.  We've already been ushered in the front and out the back door. 
But.... 

    When I was growing up in Massachusetts, one of my neighbors down the 
street kept chickens. 
Teddy Wheeler and I used to sneak into the coop late and night and blow a 
whistle as loud as we could. 

     It was sorta fun to watch what happened next.

Subject:	GOVERNORS' ONLY CALL---ESEA

Governor----------There was a Governors only call with the WH this morning.  I covered for the office.  It was a quick call.  
 
The WH updated Govs on education legislation.  Theyre hoping to get Govs to call delegation members and urge them to pass ESEA before Congress goes home for Christmas.
 
The bill as currently conferenced has a 38% increase in the programs for No child left behind; a 16% increase in IDEA; and 21% overall increase in ESEA.  The bill also provides greater, enhanced flexibility to the states.
 
Very few questions were askedactually 2:
 
*	If a state has already developed tests, will the current tests be allowed under the legislation?           WH responded that provided the tests meet the standards, they will be allowed.
 
*	Is the Administration keeping track of the dollars sent directly to the districts?        WH responded that it would be difficult given that there are dollars provided to the districts in almost all titles of ESEA.  But, the WH will contact the Sec of Educ to see if some tracking system could be established.
 
I later followed up with a phone call to the WH to clarify that the bill contains language reimbursing those states that have already developed standards and tests----  providing states dollars to develop tests is not the same as reimbursements.  They assured us that the dollars are indeed flowing to states that have already developed tests.  $3m will come our way and some additional amount will be provided based on a formula of population and poverty.
 
I asked Melissa to follow up with Congressional staff and make sure the language stays in.
 
WH also urged communicating with delegations in support of TPA; and, there may be another Governors only call on Thurs or Friday with Mark Weinberger, Asst Sec, Treasury, re economic stimuli.  (One Governor immediately talked about the costs to states on current economic stimulus proposals.)

Subject:	Business Groups--Economic Survey Results

This is a report on the results of the eighth week of economic surveys conducted by the Florida Retail Federation, National Federation of Independent Business, Associated Industries of Florida, the Florida Chamber of Commerce, and the Florida Hotel and Motel Association.  We have not reported the survey results in over a month because of some data collection problems.  The surveys will continue through the end of December.

For the four weeks ending November 26, the survey results across all industry groups show stability in sales and employment (compared to the same period last year).  Conditions do not seem to be getting noticeably worse or better right now. For sales compared to the same week last year, 40% of respondents indicated that they had lower sales, compared to 42% a month ago.  The negative responses for employment (26% of respondents) are about the same as the 24% recorded a month ago.  

On the upside, though, responses regarding the economic outlook have improved some.    

The occupancy survey results below show there has been some recent improvement in occupancy rates in central Florida, but occupancy rates and average daily room rates across the state are still significantly below last year's levels.  The FHMA also reports an improving outlook in the industry though current conditions are not good.

Don:

-------YOU MAY EDIT THE LETTER BELOW--------- 

I am writing to urge you to recommend that the Governor 
and Cabinet deny the request of Cape Canaveral Hospital 
/Health First Inc. to engage in a submerged land exchange 
that would allow it to fill in fragile Aquatic Preserve 
areas surrounding Cape Canaveral Hospital. The proposed 
"open water fill" in a Florida estuary, Aquatic Preserve, 
Outstanding Florida Waters area, would constitute a 
major reversal of state policy that has protected our 
bays and estuaries for over 30 years.  

The proposed state land exchange is of little functional 
value to the public and certainly does not justify 
a decision resulting in filling 8.8 acres of the Banana 
River, within the Indian River Aquatic Preserve. The 
likelihood that Cape Canaveral Hospital/Health First 
Inc. could ever obtain permits to develop the 37 acres 
of areas covered by heavy sea grass is slim, and therefore, 
the "trade" is not worth considering.  

Cape Canaveral Hospital/Health First Inc. is NOT in 
a "hardship" situation. This massive health care organization 
maintains at least 4 major hospital or health care 
campuses in Brevard County. The size of its 11 acre 
fill pad at Cape Canaveral Hospital in the Banana River 
does NOT limit its capability to deliver countywide 
health care services; it can simply provide them at 
one of its other many locations. Further, Health First, 
Inc. owns substantial vacant property nearby in Brevard 
County, and the City of Cocoa Beach. 

Even on the 11-acre fill pad at Cape Canaveral Hospital 
itself, there are substantial opportunities to locate 
additional facilities WITHOUT placing any more fill 
in the river. Much of the space on this site is used 
in a very inefficient manner, including large areas 
of unused paved parking. If this site were more efficiently 
utilized, much if not all of the expansion proposed 
by Health First, Inc. could be accomplished without 
filling the Banana River. 

It is highly questionable for the state to support 
expansion of a health care facility on a low-lying 
island in the middle of the Banana River. This site 
would be subject to massive storm surges in the event 
of a major hurricane impacting this portion of the 
Brevard County coastline. While successful evacuation 
of the patents and workers at this facility might be 
possible in advance of a storm event, the inevitable 
damage to the health care facility itself would represent 
huge financial loss to the community, not to mention 
interruption of health care services. The state should 
not make a decision, which encourages or facilitates 
the further expansion of a health care facility at 
this obviously dangerous, and inappropriate location.

Subject:	Impact Fee Legislation Needed Now

The Honorable Jeb Bush 
The Capitol 
Tallahassee, FL  32399 

Dear Governor Bush: 

Our mutual friend, DBPR Secretary Kim Binkley-Seyer, advised me that she 
forwarded to you a copy of my recent interview in the Sarasota Herald 
Tribune ("Getting Growth to Pay for Itself--and Setting the Price", Nov. 18, 
2001).   If you have had a chance to peruse the article then you have a good 
understanding of the basis of my concern that the imposition of impact fees 
for roads, schools, etc. by local governments is getting more and more out 
of control every day. 

In the wake of recent economic turmoil, and higher workers' compensation and 
other insurance costs to take effect January 1st, exacerbated by the higher 
costs to be imposed by the new Florida Building Code, we need State impact 
fee legislation enacted as soon as possible. 

As a member of the Sarasota County School Board Capital Budget Committee, 
and as a local resident with children in the public schools, I certainly 
empathize with school districts' needs for more capital and operating 
funding, especially right here in Sarasota County.  Recent efforts to 
consider school impact fees in Sarasota and Manatee Counties following Lee 
County's recent $2,100+ per unit school impact fee just enacted are 
misdirected, knee-jerk reactions to the current school funding crisis.  If 
public schools exist because public education provides a public benefit then 
we must conclude that public education should be funded by the broadest 
funding sources, such as the property tax and the sales tax. 

Impact fees should have no place in this discussion without evidence that 
every home yields public school children.  In fact, a great deal of evidence 
to the contrary exists.  All impact fees do is steal money from people who 
in all probability have no impact on the school system.  The State should 
not be allowing local governments to rob innocent people, and that is 
exactly what is transpiring across our State. 

If impact fee supporters were truly interested in being sure that those 
causing the impact paid for that impact, then it would be infinitely more 
reasonable to charge a school enrollment fee that covers the pro rata share 
of capital and operating expenses.  And if we choose to do that, then we 
have effectively chosen to privatize the public school system. 

Florida needs to re-enact a moratorium on school impact fees while 
legislation is drafted to solve the operating and capital school funding 
issues.  The two mill limitation on capital funding (Section 236.25(2) F.S.) 
should be targeted as the primary source for addressing the construction 
issues.  Schools today cost a lot more than they did when the two mill limit 
was enacted.  New technology alone adds significant new costs that were 
never envisioned even 10-15 years ago.  If 2.2 mills, or some other millage 
rate solves the problem, then let's look into it. 

The State, I believe, should seriously consider establishing a base level of 
service for elementary, middle and high schools (maximum number of students 
per classroom, for example) that the State commits to funding, much as like 
the State requires local governments to establish cost feasible levels of 
service for other local infrastructure.  Any higher levels of service that a 
local school board wishes to adopt should be funded locally with few strings 
attached by the State. 

With regard to other impact fees, particularly for roads, the abuses I have 
witnessed in Sarasota and Manatee Counties and elsewhere in calculating and 
administering these fees demands action.  Sarasota County, contrary to its 
own past practice, and in conflict with its own commissioned fiscal and 
economic impact study of growth, now refuses to include credits for other 
tax payments being used to fund the same road capacity improvements paid by 
impact fees.  We have been advised by legal and economics experts that this 
is clearly contrary to Florida case law.  Manatee County has adopted road 
fee increases to go into effect January 1st that increase fees 25-40 percent 
based on their decision to update only one single variable in their fee 
formula, while ignoring a number of other factors that would have reduced 
the fees.  We are now faced with the prospect of hiring our own costly 
consultants to challenge their faulty update methodology. 

The Manatee County School Board was told this week by a consultant that they 
could adopt fees anywhere between $1,000 and $5,000!  Lee County School 
Board was well on their way to adopting even higher fees than they 
ultimately did before they were shown by the Florida Homebuilders' 
consultants that the Board's consultants had made egregious errors in their 
calculations.  More litigation is likely. 

Obviously, there is way too much leeway in arriving at these kinds of 
dollars.  We would much rather see an "Impact Fee Fairness" Bill adopted, 
which we have drafted and are reviewing with local legislators, than to file 
lawsuits. 

At least a dozen other states have impact fee enabling legislation that 
define the ground rules for calculating and administering impact fees. 
Florida statutes only allow it as a "development regulation" and leave it up 
to the courts to sort out the rest.  The courts alone cannot be expected to 
rule on every impact fee calculation issue and put the building and 
development communities in a costly litigious contest with the local 
agencies that (sometimes reluctantly) issue their permits. 

Of course, I could go on and on, but out of at least some respect for your 
time I will end here with the hope that this issue can be addressed soon by 
the legislature and receive your administration's support.  I would be 
pleased to assist you and your staff, the legislature and others in any way 
I can in this effort to correct a terrible injustice that is being placed on 
an industry that does so much for our State's economy and families. 

Very truly yours,

Subject:	RE: Palm Beach Post article

Governor -- 

There are many ways we can go in this response, and since you didn't respond 
to the Ocala one (we're redrafting), I thought I would get a pre-approval on 
an outline, which will also help OPB: 

1)  Refute one key fact in Date's analysis to cast doubt on the whole thing. 
[Kim -- help, please] Do not go point-by-point.  Stay big picture. 
2)  When times are good, we spend a lot of money.  When times are bad, we 
preserve education funding as much as possible.  The vision is the same:  no 
matter what the economic circumstances, education spending is my priority. 
Cannot be refuted. 
3)  What Date's analysis really shows is that large education increases go 
hand in hand with economic prosperity.  That's why economic prosperity is so 
fundamental, and why tax cuts must also be a priority.  Again, the goose 
that lays the golden egg. 
4)  Our students are learning more.  Acccountability.  Learning gains.  $$ 
are merely a means to an end.  The end is the key. 
5)  The Future.  Yes, schools reaped a windfall over the last three years. 
Our goal: 
        -- replicate the windfall -- economy, stimulus 
        -- spend a huge chuck of the next windfall on public schools 
        -- but only in a way that increases student achievement 
6)  Ultimately, Date shows us the map we followed.  Let's continue to follow 
it.  Subtext:  critics, media have no map, they're just whining in the back 
seat saying are we there yet 

Please advise, Governor, when you have a chance...

Dear Pamella Dana: 

   As you may recall, my agency has expended considerable effort and time 
attempting to help the State of Florida jumpstart its tourism business. 

   Results: 0. 

   While our ideas have been warmly embraced by the marketing staff at 
FLAUSA, we have encountered the sternest and stiffest bureaucratic 
resistance imaginable from the higher-ups, who apparently don't want to be 
bothered with anyone or anything that might possibly upset the status quo. 

   Yesterday in Orlando, President Bush said, "I hate the bureaucracy."  He 
was referring to the plight of a small businessman whose SBA application had 
gotten lost in the quagmire of Washington red tape.  That quagmire exists 
everywhere, including Tallahassee. 

    Elected representatives are keenly sensitive to the needs and opinions 
of their constituents.  Appointed officials less so.  Tenured bureaucrats 
hardly at all.  The latter are concerned primarily with their own 
perquisites, powers, protocols, procedural niceties and personal position in 
the political pecking order. 

   Sadly, there is really only one effective way to influence any 
bureaucracy - other than appeal directly in person, on-air, to The President 
of The United States. 

   Tomorrow morning we email and mail the following to every newspaper, wire 
service, radio & TV news department in Florida.  Since you have been 
reasonably up and up with me, I'm giving you the courtesy of a first FYI:

Anyone in who works in Florida's tourism industry should know that the 
$20,000,000  emergency marketing fund voted on yesterday by the legislature 
may or may not  be spent on ads that actually bring tourists to Florida.  It 
all depends... 

According to the marketing department of FLAUSA, the quasi-governmental 
marketing co-coordinator for the Department of Tourism, every dollar in 
state funds must be matched by a dollar or more in corporate funds. 

So the state's agency of record, Fahlgren & Geiger in Tampa, must first sell 
their creative ideas to co-op sponsors such as Holiday Inns, Budget Rent a 
Car, and Delta Airlines.  If Fahlgren is successful they, and they alone, 
get $20 million + $20 million in windfall billings. 

But what if corporate sponsors are tapped out?  What if they don't 
particularly care for Fahlgren's jingles or TV spots?  Then nothing could 
happen.  According to FLAUSA's rules, no other marketing, advertising and 
promotional firms are allowed to contact, present ideas to, and solicit 
co-op funding from anyone on Fahlgren's proprietary list of corporate 
contacts. 

Fahlgren won the state's business fair and square - during peacetime when 
tourism was booming and just about any ad could get people to fly or drive 
here.  Today we're in a war and a recession.  The stakes are huge.  There's 
no guarantee that Fahlgren can attract $20,000,000 in co-op dollars, or that 
their ideas, and theirs alone, will motivate terrified tourists in Georgia, 
New York to Toronto to come back to Florida. 

Florida can't afford to bet its entire tourism industry on one ad agency. 

The Department of Tourism should immediately issue an RFP to all ad agencies 
and marketing firms in the state; invite everyone to Tallahassee in 30 days; 
give everyone a chance to pitch their ideas to all the corporate marketing 
directors and tourism officials - all at once. 

We want tourists to vote for Florida's best with their dollars.  Why 
shouldn't't corporate sponsors be given the same opportunity?

    Do I expect anything good to come out of this for The Burkhard Agency? 
Not really.  We've already been ushered in the front and out the back door. 
But....

street kept chickens. 
Teddy Wheeler and I used to sneak into the coop late and night and blow a 
whistle as loud as we could.

Subject: Enterprise Florida introduction / UnitedWeRide / Sept 11th
Jeb,
 
We met briefly on your trip to Silicon Valley with Enterprise Florida this year.   Hope things are well in Florida.  I am a partner at Hummer Winblad Venture Partners, was the former Navy fighter pilot, US Naval Academy graduate, served in Jacksonville Florida, started UnheardSoldier effort last December related to military ballots.
 
Realize your time is at absolute premium but wanted to make you aware of another effort I kickstarted but now has life of its own.  We are aggregating high profile support / board involvement as we speak.  Would like to get your input on a few fronts so let me explain some detail.
 
Immediately after Sept. 11th events, I started organizing a national bicycle ride called UnitedWeRide  <http://www.unitedweride.org/> www.unitedweride.org 501(c)(3) with mission statement / charter to assist families impacted by terrorism, and also create national participatory tribute to those lost that day.  Originally was going to be grassroots effort but response was incredible so shifted quickly to larger, organized, professional event.  
 
The format, plan is to have bicycle riders leave from several major cities next summer (San Fran, Seattle, Los Angeles, Denver, Austin, Miami, Atlanta, Chicago, Boston) and ride through cities large / small, routes pass through Oklahoma City, United Airlines Flight 93 crash site, Arlington National Cemetery, the Pentagon, Gettysburg, Liberty Bell, and all routes will converge at Ground Zero weekend of Aug 3-4, 2002 in New York City.  All 50 states to participate, plan to get Governor support within each state for permits / routes.  
 
We also plan to have select riders carry a memorial stone for each individual lost in war on terrorism (this would include Sept. 11th, but also other losses, Anthrax, servicemen and women lost in battle, leading up to next summer).  I have approached the families of some friends lost about this, and the families of some of the passengers from UA Flight 93 to get their perspective / support.  And also to get sense of whether they would have an interest in getting a particular family member / team together to "carry", in tributary, honor guard fashion, their individual memorial (which some very much do, all are supportive of effort).
 
UnitedWeRide has the event planning group that put on 1996 Olympic bike events, San Francisco Grand Prix supporting this, and we are putting A+ support structure in place to pull this off.  So far response has been overwhelming.  New York City said they would 'open their arms' to this next August.  Lance Armstrong, Tour de France winner 3 years running, will be part of final ride weekend.  Plan to make formal press announcement by end of year.
 
We are also approaching individuals to present a world class Board / Honorary Chairperson in major cities represented in the ride (some high profile personalities that represent all that is great about USA).  Board member commitment no more than 3-4 Board meetings leading up to next summer, Honorary Chairperson will be personality in particular city that will show up and kick off ride that day in that city.  We are approaching Astronaut Jim Lovell and retired General Norman Schwarzkopf for example as well as leaders in industry to participate.  
 
Would like to get your input on someone you think would be Honorary Chairperson for the City of Miami, a key origination city.  And your input as Governor on the overall effort.  It would be great to get a state Governor champion to support and help rally the nation's Governors behind UnitedWeRide.
 
I know the President is too busy to focus on this, but we are approaching Lee Haney, the current Chairman of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, to determine if there is interest in supporting, being involved in UnitedWeRide.
 
(btw, I have no personal interest in recognition, etc., from this...none.  This is for the country and the families.  It is already shaping up that the existing supporting cast, high profile folks will take center stage and I can fade into background.)
 
UnitedWeRide is already an official corporation.  Right now there are core groups in New York and Silicon Valley that are helping this move forward.  This may be the largest cycling event / peacetime domestic sporting event in history if the event planning projections play out.
 
Do you have 5 minutes to discuss / any initial reaction to the event itself or suggesting on who best to represent Miami?  Happy to discuss with appropriate person / staff when able and provide more details.

Regards,

Dan

Dear Governor Bush:

       With all that is going on in the Great State of Florida, the Nation, and the World I will try to keep this e-mail brief.  In your speech to the Florida League of Cities Downtown Redevelopment Seminar held in Miami you stated that your e-mail is one of the best ways to get in touch with you.
       As an elected official I know first hand how hard it is to keep track of everything that is going on.  However, when I feel someone is treated improperly I work hard to rectify the situation.  
       You can imagine how hard it is to survive as a small business man these days.  As if the economy were not bad enough, one of your agencies is causing me unnecessary problems.  I submitted an application to the Department of Business and Professional Regulation, Board of Funeral Directors and Embalmers to open a new cinerator (crematory) facility.  In my twenty-one years in this profession I have received one minor complaint which currently pending against me.  The Departments Legal Advisor (Charles Tunnicliff) has specifically stated to my attorney that the staff of the Department is improperly using a statute to deny my final inspection.  I invested $100,000.00 in the construction and equipment for the cinerator facility.  I hired two additional staff members to operate the facility.  When I made application to the Department in May/2001 I was told my inspection would take place in 30 days.  Well, its now December and I have been forced to sell the crematory at a loss, I have suffered tens of thousands of dollars in lost income, and I am being forced to terminate the two employee's.  As if that were not enough, the Department is denying my request to have my $400.00+ application fee refunded.  They have taken no action on my application.  I should at least be entitled to a refund of my application fee.  
       Again, (in summary) I lose a new business venture, I lose tens of thousands of dollars in income, I am adding two more people to the unemployment lines, and I can't even get my lousy 400+ dollars back.  Needless, to say I am appalled at the Departments handling of this matter.
       Governor Bush, I believe you are a sincere, honest man, who cares a lot about all of us.  I support you and all that you have tried to do to downsize and limit government spending.  I have been one of your most outspoken supporters in local and statewide political circles.  Of course having the former Chairwoman of the Brevard Republican Executive Committee as a mother; in her eyes Republicans can do no wrong (especially a Bush)!  Please take this matter under consideration.  I want to continue to be in your corner as we go into this election year.  I need your help!  Persons working for you should promote commerce and the economy not help tear it down.

Governor - 

I think that you are right on target with your new tourism initiatives.  To 
me, FLA-USA stands for FLORIDA --- "Unlimited State Appeal".  It's appeal is 
UNIQUE as well, but I think it's more accurate to say - UNLIMITED. 

Our family in fact had two week-long vacations this year and both were 
within Florida.  I've now been to 33 different countries and over 40 states, 
but I find that Florida itself offers more than enough variety, 
entertainment and sheer vacation value.  It's like multiple states & nations 
all rolled into one. 

Except for the Inaugural Ball back in January, the next Bush Inaugural to 
come - and your two future Inaugurals... I can't think of a really good 
reason to travel beyond our borders.  *** I actually wouldn't mind making it 
to the "Rose Bowl" (since the Canes have been my favorite team since the 
days of Jim Kelley), but tickets to that one aren't likely and Pasadena is 
just too far... 

This is exactly why I was so keen on that Florida Film Commissioner or 
Deputy Commissioner opportunity... there's just no other place on Earth like 
FLA-USA... Florida has it all and moreover - it can appear on film like 
anywhere you ever would want to or need to go... 

Please keep up the effective cheerleading on Florida's behalf and keep us 
all on the right track.  Florida will rebound soon and stronger than ever.  

Take care -

Governor: Drivers licenses are being issued concurrent with INS document expiration dates in two offices statewide with an additional ten offices coming online 12/10. The remaining 150 offices will begin issuing said licenses 12/18. As part of the Task Force plan submitted to FDLE, those driver license applicants who present foreign national documents for identification purposes will receive a non-photo paper driver license at the office. Highway Safety Dept. will then verify the identity documents within 30 days, central issue a digitized photo driver license and mail same from Tallahassee. This process is on the same time schedule as above. Should you need more detail as to which offices come online on specific dates please advise.Fred.

Per our Driver License Strategic Plan filed with the Florida Department of

strengthen domestic security is to begin limiting the duration of driver 
licenses to the duration of pertinent Immigration and Naturalization Service 
documents.  

The computer software modifications we began in mid-November to accomplish 
this procedural change have just been completed.  The first test of this 
rollout began yesterday at our Pembroke Pines driver license office and all 
went well.  We will phase-in all other driver license offices over the next

Drivers 
  License Bureau and observed many people with Visa's that expire this month 

  yet still given a Florida License that is good for four years.  About 30 
  percent of the people coming into this office were from other countries. 
If

Brian, this is just an FYI.  The man below called regarding the Federal Sales Tax Holiday.  He is a car dealer in central Florida and wanted the Governor to know that some people are postponing vehicle purchases because they are waiting to see whether or not the Feds enact it.  He just wanted to plead for a fast resolution to the issue so customers will know what is going on.  He's also concerned that if the federal holiday passes that it will squeeze a tremendous amount of business into a short period of time at the expense of periods before and after.  We would expect this behavior, especially for durable goods.

Here is so more information about the A.B.L.E Center and the run around that Lori Bennett (if it's a real name) is
giving us. She used God's name for us to trust her. I now have a strong feeling that the all thing is a BIG scam.
I warned this morning Mary O'Meara from S.P.A.R.C in Volusia County who is hosting the A.B.L.E vision on
the 12th of this month, Mary told me that she was going to write to you too. 
Please, this is very important, can you have someone checking on this. 
I know that I have been asking help from you many times for our children, but if this is a group of Scientologists,
we need to find out and protec our angels.
 
Sincerely
 
Beatrice

Hello Elly,
 
I think that Lori Bennett is getting very concerned about what I found about A.B.L.E International.
When I open the website   http://www.able.org/index.htm   Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology is
on that web page. 
Elly I have to be carefull, if this is the biggest scam and they discover that I discovered all this, they
might try to stop me.

Hello Lori,
 
Reading the first Email that was send to me. I saw that you were talking about oversees. Maybe you don't know but I am originally
from Europe. 
 
To briefly give a broad overview of the program:  The A.B.L.E. (Achieving Beyond Limited Expectations) Foundation, Inc. establishes, oversees, manages, and assists in the funding of each A.B.L.E. Center.  Strict quality control is essential to insure that our programs and services are provided in top-notch fashion.  The creation of each A.B.L.E. Center is simply a process of duplication.  The system has been developed and we are now ready to implement the creation of the Centers throughout the state in each community.  It is a very simple process to follow, but it does take commitment from the community and the families who will benefit from each Center.  So, if you are interested in helping to spear-head, so to speak, this project in YOUR community, please let us know as soon as possible.
 
so, I checkeed it up and found A.B.L.E International. that seems to be another wonderfull organization like yours.
that are helping people and I thought that you at least knew about it or maybe be part of A.B.L.E international.
You didn't tell me about NY and California I noticed. Could you please tell me?
 
God bless
 
Beatrice

Good evening Lori,
 
Thanks for your answers. It must be wonderful that you can volunteer all your time and that you are financially independent.
Right away, I can't have food or drinks inside the building in our local Library but it was nice of you to offer.
Where in NY and California do you have A.B.L.E Centers at various stages? I have friends and Family in those State too.
Are you associate with A.B.L.E  International?
Thanks again for answering my questions.
 
SIncerely

Hi Beatrice -
 
From reading your email, I can see why so many people are emailing me with compliments about you and your commitment to help people with disabilities!  You are busy gathering information and the people who can help make this awesome A.B.L.E. Vision a reality in Osceola County!
 
Great news about the meeting room.  We'll provide the refreshments.
 
We need to reach out to parents and families with children of all ages with disabilities - adults especially, too.  Encourage people to reach out to other people they have never really stopped to talk to.  Asking people if they have heard about the A.B.L.E. Vision and how it can benefit the community is a great way to get a conversation started.  
 
To answer your questions from your other email I received today:
 
We have A.B.L.E. Centers in various stages of opening in Illinois, California, Alabama, Georgia, and New York, so far with plans to open in all 50 states and Canada.
 
As a foundation, we are automatically a not-for-profit organization.  We are fully funded.  We are a group of philanthropists who are providing the seed money and the funding for this project.
 
We have the funding and will purchase the land the Centers will be built upon.
 
We have the funding to open the centers.  We need to make sure that the communities we choose to open a center in are able to keep it open.  Our concept is unique and it is not comparable to any other program currently open anywhere in this country serving people with disabilities.
 
We are volunteers in that we are financially independent and are able to volunteer our time without worrying about compensation.  
 
We are a private board of directors.  We do not solicit board members.
 
The A.B.L.E. Vision is a gift from God.
 
Our son, Daniel, who is 23 years old, is the inspiration for the A.B.L.E. Concept.
 
Our system works because it has taken more than 10 years to research, develop, and fine tune.  It is based upon success principles that are proven to be true.  We are here to serve, we are not self-seeking, nor do we seek fame or fortune.  We have no personal agendas - this is truly a gift from God - we are simply the vessles He is using.
 
As far as the actual buildings for the A.B.L.E. Center, we have architectural drawings of the A.B.L.E. Vision.  Approdx. 10-25 acres are necessary depending upon the needs of the communities we will be serving and the extent of the programs and services we will provide.
 
It is refreshing to see that you have questions and that you are thinking about this project in depth.  Ask any question you would like - that's perfectly fine!
 
Beatrice - you are doing a great job so far gathering informatin and people together and coordinating the meeting room and date and for getting the word out.  I saw the message on the hawke list today.  
 
We are open to questions, comments, and suggestions.  We are here to serve the needs of the community.  We are NOT funded by the government or any other agency - private or public.  We are free to dream big and to make those dreams a reality - together!
 
Keep doing what you are doing.  With the news about the state funding cutbacks, people are really getting desperate for help and for programs and services.  A.B.L.E. is the answer.
 
We are NOT affiliated in any way with the ABLE trust.  That is a state agency/organization.  Our name is a acronym for Achieving Beyond Limited Expectations.  
 
We can't wait to meet you and the dynamic Osceola group!
 
Warm regards,
Lori Bennett
Ambassador of Hope

Another Whats going on in Lake Panasoffkee, Governor Bush? 
Some time ago the Blade asked this same question. Its appearance on the web aroused the ire of some individuals, so in the thinking of this editor it was believed some education benefits toward what public disclosures can provide was accomplished. Due to a number of recent questions being raised by some Lake P citizens, however, maybe the belief was similar to the old adage of yelling against the wind? 
To recap, the state legislature some two years ago said in passing a Bill that was to provide about $26 million dollars over five years (paraphrased here) that the Lake was a state treasure owned by all its citizens, and the sad, man mangled mess needed restoration before it was totally lost. A lake restoration committee set-up began, that to shorten a long involved session of political finagling, ended up as being less in number of members as originally planned by governor appointment, all placed in office by the local county commission. Not unexpected, some well-known local power players, according to citizen activists, ended up in a majority of those seats that has guided matters ever since. 
Their first project decided upon was to restore sections on the lakes east side around Colemans Landing, an uninhabited shore a far piece for any boat trailering, that had public access right of way and was at one time a prime fishery area. Unfortunately, due to contentions that native aquatic plants must be allowed to repopulate the dredged areas, public access there is still a figment for future decision. Waterfront dwellers on the west shore where a major Sumter County population resides are mad. Especially canal property owners who cant get anything done, once privy to clean, clear runs to open water but now landlocked by excess weeds and muck buildup, are not happy to know that as a practical matter, only fish camp owners and their customers for the most part are reaping any benefits from this cost-overrun, millions of dollars operation. Some fish camp owners they point out who set on the restorations committee. 
Recently the chorus of questioners has widened and deepened apparently. It now is being noised about that as dredging activity has been transferred to the west side of the lake, clearing of the channel from one of said fish camps to open water, and a open lakefront restoration along another committee members property ongoing, is stirring real heat to an already hot mix. A mix that embroils state and county money, hard to track according to these activists with agencies like Swiftmud and the Fish and Game Department trying to roil the pot on the side. 
Yep, Governor! If any parts of the above are true, Id say you and some others got a big problem. Come to think of it, even the perception evidently affecting a bunch of folks, smells pretty bad in these volatile times. What do you say? LCA[] 

Governor Bush: A letter advising the Attorney Generals office of criminal actions in the above program from a Mr. Knute Dobson of Lake Panasoffkee has been copied to me as the Citrus-Sumter Blade editor. Complaint is made this notification is being ignored by the AG. Could your office look into these matters? L. C. Alexander[]

Subject:	Thanks for budget crisis rescue

Dear Jeb, 
Hope all is well with you and your family.  Thank you for the consideration 
you have given to autism and the entire DD population in the special session 
and the budget crisis.  Your influence and leadership have not gone 
unnoticed. 

We have been trying to amass local dollars, both public and private, to fund 
programs for children that will suffer i.e. child care and summer programs, 
extended school year, etc.  Now is a perfect opportunity to encourage the 
local community leadership to fill in the gaps for those programs that have 
experienced cuts. 

The good new is property values are at an all time high in Broward and we 
have a new children's taxing district.   Bad news is the new council and the 
county commission feel that if they step up to the plate and fund lost 
dollars, the state will abandon their responsibility, when it is in a 
position to fund. 

Efforts have been initiated to bring their attention to these pressing 
concerns and hopefully we will be successful. The disabled population is not 
represented on the council and, as I predicted, have been left out of the 
mix. Our highly successful Inclusive Childcare Project is in trouble.  Since 
there is no special needs catagory, we structured a request around their 
guidlines in the abused and neglected category (which many become), they 
then informed us they would not accept lost dollar applications.  We have 
over 350 children in this program and a waiting list.  Your support for this 
effort with the Children's Services Council here in Broward would be greatly 
appreciated. 

Unfortunately, some have the feeling that dollars would be better spent on 
children that are not so "hopeless" and can transition into the community.  
Disabled children through no fault of their own are not being treated 
equitably in this process. 

Which brings me to this quote I wanted you to see that offended many parents 
who have fought so long in education and have the same hopes and dreams for 
their children as everyone else. 
********************************************************************** 
Quote from Chair of President Bush's Commission on Special 
Education 

Gov. Branstad (former governor of Iowa) has been appointed to serve as 
chair of the Administration's new special education commission. 

Following is a quote from Gov Branstad (Iowa) from an interview 
transcript. The entire transcript is available at: 

http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/education/schools_1-16.html 

GOV. TERRY BRANSTAD: In our state nearly 60 percent of the budget goes 
for education. And what we find is people are willing to invest in 
quality education, but they are also fiscally conservative. They want to 
see results. They want to see achievement for the dollars that they put 
in. I think that the federal government in its mandates in the area of 
special ed has driven up costs needlessly. I think that needs to be 
reviewed. 

I want to see every child have an opportunity to learn. All special 
ed children do have a right to an education, but to spend tens 
oft thousands of dollars on kids that really are not going to be able to 
support themselves or be able to really learn a great deal at the 
expense of the general education of the rest of the students is not 
fair. 

And so that has to be addressed. A lot of people are afraid of it, 
of being, you know, accused of being insensitive or whatever. I was 
in Sioux City, Iowa, yesterday, and I heard from a Teacher of the Year, 
Nancy Mounts, who had been Teacher of the Year, and the 
superintendent there about how their school is being squeezed 
because of the federal mandates in the area of special ed and 
how there needs to be more flexibility and latitude given to local 
school districts in that area. 

******************************************************************** 


Jeb, if you ever cross paths with Governor Branstad, maybe you could mention 
that all children can learn and although many do not learn through 
traditional methods, no child should be left behind.  They should never be 
penalized or treated as damaged goods with no hope or potential. 

A sincere and heartfelt "Thank You" for all you do and for your past 
support.  You have my undaunted support and commitment for your re-election. 
  Please let me know what I can do to help you here in Broward. 
Good Luck and have a blessed holiday! 

Susan

Subject:	Education -- State Diplomas

Dear Governor Bush: 

With more and more people choosing home school for their children, I would like to suggest a change in the Florida High School Diploma (GED) program.   Many of the home schoolers prescribe to a rigorous course of study yet they are only eligible for the GED Diploma, which to the best of my knowledge, can only be obtained by those under 18 by attending special GED classes.    The problem with this is twofold -- 1.) Many home schoolers curriculum is much more challenging than the GED classes and taking those are only a waste of time 2.) the General Studies Diploma only test for basic skills.   

My suggestion is that the state offer two different tests -- keep the General Education Diploma program with its study classes as is, and add a new test, for the more challenging curriculum and allow students 16 and older to take it so that they can continue their studies at colleges and universities when they are ready. 

Thank you for your consideration.

Governor,
 
Thought you might want to see this email.  By the way John Rood suggested that you give Dr. Lazzara a call due to the huge support he has given you and your brother. What do you think about writing him a note?  Thought this may smooth things over.........just a suggestion sir.

I saw a  very interesting article about the National  Governors 
Association. Are you a member of this association?  If so, I would like to 
 encourage you to save the tax payers of our state and resign from this

Another Whats going on in Lake Panasoffkee, Governor Bush? 
Some time ago the Blade asked this same question. Its appearance on the web aroused the ire of some individuals, so in the thinking of this editor it was believed some education benefits toward what public disclosures can provide was accomplished. Due to a number of recent questions being raised by some Lake P citizens, however, maybe the belief was similar to the old adage of yelling against the wind? 
To recap, the state legislature some two years ago said in passing a Bill that was to provide about $26 million dollars over five years (paraphrased here) that the Lake was a state treasure owned by all its citizens, and the sad, man mangled mess needed restoration before it was totally lost. A lake restoration committee set-up began, that to shorten a long involved session of political finagling, ended up as being less in number of members as originally planned by governor appointment, all placed in office by the local county commission. Not unexpected, some well-known local power players, according to citizen activists, ended up in a majority of those seats that has guided matters ever since. 
Their first project decided upon was to restore sections on the lakes east side around Colemans Landing, an uninhabited shore a far piece for any boat trailering, that had public access right of way and was at one time a prime fishery area. Unfortunately, due to contentions that native aquatic plants must be allowed to repopulate the dredged areas, public access there is still a figment for future decision. Waterfront dwellers on the west shore where a major Sumter County population resides are mad. Especially canal property owners who cant get anything done, once privy to clean, clear runs to open water but now landlocked by excess weeds and muck buildup, are not happy to know that as a practical matter, only fish camp owners and their customers for the most part are reaping any benefits from this cost-overrun, millions of dollars operation. Some fish camp owners they point out who set on the restorations committee. 
Recently the chorus of questioners has widened and deepened apparently. It now is being noised about that as dredging activity has been transferred to the west side of the lake, clearing of the channel from one of said fish camps to open water, and a open lakefront restoration along another committee members property ongoing, is stirring real heat to an already hot mix. A mix that embroils state and county money, hard to track according to these activists with agencies like Swiftmud and the Fish and Game Department trying to roil the pot on the side. 
Yep, Governor! If any parts of the above are true, Id say you and some others got a big problem. Come to think of it, even the perception evidently affecting a bunch of folks, smells pretty bad in these volatile times. What do you say? LCA[] 

Governor Bush: A letter advising the Attorney Generals office of criminal actions in the above program from a Mr. Knute Dobson of Lake Panasoffkee has been copied to me as the Citrus-Sumter Blade editor. Complaint is made this notification is being ignored by the AG. Could your office look into these matters? L. C. Alexander[]

Dear Governor Bush: 

Just a quick refresher ..this is the third year I have alerted you to Kids 
for Peace Pilgrimage Week which, this year runs all this week, Dec. 3-7. 

Last year, if you recall, the children wrote letters to the President 
suggesting how he could bring peace and reconcile the country after such a 
tortuous election and we sent copies, at your request, to you. You were kind 
enough to send a handwritten note which meant a lot to the children. 

I have just heard your brother today suggesting that Americans pray that God 
will put a protective shield over America. He should know that there are 71 
Kids for Peace Schools throughout the nation praying...somewhere between 35 
and 40,000 children. They are also selling a bumper sticker created by a 5 
year old which reads "Peace, please! Do it for us kids - Tommy". The profits 
are being sent to the President's Afghan children's fund. 

Florida once again leads the nation in little peace pilgrims...some 20,000 in 
this state alone, with Pennsylvania second and Texas a distant third. 

Schools were urged to invite you to one of their events this week. I hope 
they did as seeing is believing. My husband, who served with your father in 
Congress and has seen a great deal, said he was "overwhelmed" by a pilgrimage 
he attended in Miami. Mrs. Don Shula who is on our board is greatly 
responsible for 26 schools in Miami-Dade county becoming Kids for Peace 
schools. 

If you wish to follow the week through the Internet, please visit our 
website..www.peacethroughlove.org and click on FrontPageNews 

Bill and I send best regards to your Mom and Dad. Your brother is in our 
prayers everyday. 

Peace!

Dear Jeb, 
Our Florida economy depends on keeping our beaches clean and free of debris and oil.
Please do whatever necessary to stop the drilling off the coast.  I know of no one who wants spoiled beaches.  
We had an oil spill off the coast of Indian Rocks Beach about 10 years ago.  It was horrible.  Tourism stopped and the beach businesses came to a standstill.
We cannot allow this to happen on a larger scale!!!!!!!

I am well aware of the recent events that have changed our lives forever. 
However, this is a vital natural resource for the entire State of Florida. 
We must preserve it before it is to late.  We are very close to losing the

Dear Gov. Bush (Jeb) ,
 
My name is Ed French (Edwin C. French III) ,
I am writing as per several sources state that you are probably the only person that can help and might consider helping me with this problem . I am originally a born-and-raised Floridian who now resides in the State of Arizona . Nearly all of my childhood family ties remain in Orlando and surrounding areas .
 
In 1981 , I was sentenced after submitting a guilty plea for a white-collar non-violent crime for which I served time on in the Deland facility for Volusia County . The Honorable McFerrin Smith was acting Judge in this case during Sept. of 1981 . Four months after I was introduced to facility my case was reviewed , between going from Maximum security at time of intake to Trustee in three months , my 1 year sentence was commuted to probation and I was released the morning before Christmas .
 
Jeb , since that time ( 20 years ago ) , I have been a productive taxpayer , model employee , devoted husband and most recently an exuberant and loving father to my 9 year old daughter Meaghan who I adore . Other than an occasional traffic citation in the first 10 years , I have not had to visit a courtroom except to seek visitation for my wife Krista's Grandaughter .
 
Now that I have given you some background on myself  we come to the issue at hand . I am a mature and responsible parent , husband and citizen . I have never had a violent background or tendency . My last 3 employers cover over 11 yrs in customer service : Tucson Medical Center - 6yrs        American Airlines- 2+ years     Spherion (corporate travel agency for Amex) 3 yrs .
 
For the vast majority of these past 20 years I have had all of my Civil Liberties restored except for the Right to Bear Arms .
I live in a fairly remote area just southwest of Tucson Az. and between our location gradually becoming more urban , the state of our World today and an overwhelming desire to be able to feel safe in our home , I am asking for your help in the only way I know how . I am hoping that somewhere deep down you can relate to what I am talking about at some level .
 
Several years ago I had inquired as to the steps neccessary to re-obtain the last liberty I was still missing and was referred to ATF for more info . They stated at that time that the only way to do this was to be granted Clemency or a Pardon from the State in which the crime was committed . I left Florida in 1985 and have been an Arizona resident since 1986 . In all this time I have been back to visit my folks on a fairly regular basis and have always respected the laws and citizens of Florida .
 
I am not exactly sure what measure you would need to use to accomplish my request should you choose to help me , but any help and/or advise is welcome . Just on a side - note , Jeb , if this is something you can't do or aren't comfortable with , I'll understand . I am just a good man that made a huge mistake early in life and have paid for it ever since .
 
Thanks for taking the time .

Good "Evening Governor! 
Great job today at the Prevention Conference!  The NBC affliate ran a lengthy 
piece on the evening news on the Oxycontin issue and also covered the 
conference.  Mrs. Bush's speech this afternoon was great.  She was the only 
first lady to receive a standing ovation and it was apparent that she has 
made a great impression on the workers in the field.  The same station also 
covered your trip to Disney and the Operation Paycheck site.  Good coverage! 

Excellent news late in the day -- Judge Moreno threw out most of Giever's law 
suit in his ruling on our motion to dismiss.  I know that you get sick of the 
legal side of things -- but this is huge.  His ruling is precedential and if 
eventually upheld in an appellate court will give states the ability to do 
their job and protect kids rather than litigate.  Gievers has 21 days to 
re-file.  It will be interesting to see how the press handles this tomorrow.  
We are getting it done! 

Get some much needed rest tonight -- it was a great day for Florida.

The child was removed from both the mother's and grandmother's home due to 
domestic violence. Daughter had an attorney but asked to be removed because 
of unreconcilable differences with client. The grandmother can't intervene 
because she is not part of the judicial case. The department is not allowed 
to share the case files with the grandmother.

Dear Governor Busch, 
I live at 877 N Miramar Ave #404, Indialantic Fl 32903.  I work at Northrop 
Grumman as an Engineer and live in the Villager Condo on the beach in 
Melbourne.   The Villager is in jeopardy of being breached by the Atlantic 
Ocean.  We need Emergency funding now to prevent our home from being taken 
by the sea.  
I am well aware of the recent events that have changed our lives forever. 
However, this is a vital natural resource for the entire State of Florida. 
We must preserve it before it is to late.  We are very close to losing the 
remaining Dunes that separate us from the ocean.  Help us to keep our homes 
and maintain this natural resource, we need funding to stop this erosion 
today. 
Thank you for your consideration.       

                                Respectfully, Michael E Di Leva   Phone #

Subject: Drug Treatment Initiative Oral Argument on 12/10/01



Governor: 

As you know, we filed a brief in the Fla. Supreme Court on your behalf 
opposing the drug treatment initiative.  Oral argument is scheduled for 
Monday, Dec. 10 at 9:00 a.m.  We requested oral argument when the brief was 
filed in order to preserve the opportunity.  However, four of the five 
parties opposing the initiative -- including the EOG -- are scheduled to 
argue and have been alotted 5 minutes each.  The other parties' briefs -- 
especially that of Save Our Society from Drugs -- largely cover the same 
territory covered in our brief, although they make additional arguments, as 
well.  Because of the overlap, and because FDLE and the Prosecuting 
Attorneys Assn can adequately advance the concerns of the executive branch, 
we propose waiving or yielding our time to the other parties to best utilize 
the time given to the initiative's opponents collectively. 

Please let me know whether you agree or disagree.  Thank you.

support agency because the noncustodial parent pays less than 
court-ordered.  The children are over 18 but the father owes more than 
$130,000 in arrears!  The custodial parent knows we're doing all that we 
can and that we will continue with our efforts. 

I'm still plugging away on the case with Ms. Calloway.  It's an 
interesting one.  We've been able to collect over $10,000 on her behalf 
in the last year from court-ordered purges.  The father still won't pay 
on a regular basis but Ms. Calloway knows we are still plugging away... 

On a very good note, one of the cases you referred to us from a mother 
who wrote to you from North Carolina about a year ago reached a 
successful conclusion.  The noncustodial parent paid $15,000 to the 
custodial parent a few weeks ago to pay off all the back child support 
owed.  She was very happy to get this money.  This case is now closed. 

On another note, I know that Jim appreciates your support of the 
Department's proposal to implement an administrative support process. 
Many of the calls and e-mails I receive are from frustrated parents 
waiting for their cases to go to hearing.   Anything that can be done to 
make the establishment process more efficient will improve our level of 
service.  

I wish you and your family a very happy holiday season, 
Karen Kellams

FYI Several staff and faculty members in my department have stopped me in 
the hall today to express their outrage over Senator McKay's comments in the 
Gainesville Sun encouraging folks to take their shotguns into IFAS on a 
Friday after 4PM..  

1.  They resent the implication that IFAS folks do not work hard for their 
paychecks (and they are not aware that the Senator ever visited our building 
before making such a remark). 
2.  They feel that if any of them had made similar comments about the 
Florida Senate, that they would have been slammed into jail for threatening 
public officials carrying out their duties in a public building.  They want 
to know how anyone can get away with making such comments, especially in the 
wake of September 11th. 
3.  Several of the women who work on the first floor in my building  have 
said they now feel unsafe -- from crazies who might "take the hint" from 
McKay; I would not be surprized if some of my employees do take off this 
Friday and go home before 4PM. 

In the best of times, folks would be worried about losing their jobs; in 
these times of terrorism and other acts of public violence, this was an 
especially insensitive remark for a leading public official to make. 

Folks in my department have been pretty calm and fearless about all this 
budget-cut stuff -- they're pulling together, willing to endure the 
belt-tightening for the sake of the IFAS team, etc. (Several have inquired 
about the possibility of voluntary furloughs or going part time to prevent 
others from losing their jobs, etc.) But this latest cavalier comment from a 
key Florida legislator has REALLY ticked them off and contributed to a 
marked decline in morale. 

I know my staff and faculty are not alone in their feelings about this 
issue.  I assume other personnel in other departments are equally outraged.

I assume right now, florida agriculture community is biggest opponent of 
this.  if that assumption is correct, i would suggest doing a separate short 
paragraph to address the governor's intention to advocate for terms that 
will protect florida growers against unfair trade practices such as dumping, 
etc.  or, even better, is there anything we can say now, such as the 
president has assured us that they will vigorously protect against unfair 
trade practices.  i don't know what conversations we have had with 
administration on this. 

by way of history, Clinton promised to protect florida growers from dumping 
as part of their "look the other way" support on NAFTA.  Clinton then did 
little to help once the dumping began.  Growers are weary of similar 
overtures from new administration and similar failure to follow through.  we 
need to assure them that this is not the Clinton admininstration and that 
they will take dumping and other unfair trade practices very seriously.

Good "Evening Governor! 
Great job today at the Prevention Conference!  The NBC affliate ran a lengthy 
piece on the evening news on the Oxycontin issue and also covered the 
conference.  Mrs. Bush's speech this afternoon was great.  She was the only 
first lady to receive a standing ovation and it was apparent that she has 
made a great impression on the workers in the field.  The same station also 
covered your trip to Disney and the Operation Paycheck site.  Good coverage! 

Excellent news late in the day -- Judge Moreno threw out most of Giever's law 
suit in his ruling on our motion to dismiss.  I know that you get sick of the 
legal side of things -- but this is huge.  His ruling is precedential and if 
eventually upheld in an appellate court will give states the ability to do 
their job and protect kids rather than litigate.  Gievers has 21 days to 
re-file.  It will be interesting to see how the press handles this tomorrow.  
We are getting it done! 

Get some much needed rest tonight -- it was a great day for Florida.

Dear Govenor,

Re: Cutting Schools Budgets, 12/04/01 

To the Editors, 

TEACHERS RECENT PAY RAISES 

Under the fiscal crisis our school system is now under, I can well understand why so many people -- including the Heralds editorial staff -- believe it is best to allow the threat of pay raise rescission motivate School Board officials into finally cleaning up its fiscal bungling. But no such thing will happen. What will happen is a wholesale raid on the classroom in order to protect the teachers pay raises, i.e. the 10 percent reduction in the schools operating budgets, while mounting a propaganda campaign, with the implicit help of the Miami Herald, to convince us nothing of significance has been taken out of the classroom. 

Classroom teachers will have to make do with less under this scenario but they will have their pay raises and School Board officials and teachers union lobbyist will be armed with plenty of political cannon fodder to successfully attack politicians in the spring for not supporting public education. This has been the tried and true way School Board officials have used pending fiscal deficits in the past to secure future funding without the need to seriously address their fiscal mismanagement.  Of course, the losers in all of this are public school students themselves. 

This scenario will most certainly be played out again unless something is done to break the cycle. What is needed is to separate teachers pay raises from schools operating budgets and require any pay raises to be won or lost at the ballot box. Teachers should be accountable locally for their pay raise.  They should give up their recent pay raises and focus in on winning a pay-raise ballot initiative -- led to victory, hopefully, by the new Superintendent

We have a wonderful chance here for the people of this school district to inject real accountability into their pubic school system.  All we need is a little leadership from our School Board and, dare I say it, the Miami Herald's editorial staff.

CUTTING SCHOOLS' BUDGETS 

DIFFICULT CHOICES, RESPONSIBLE DECISIONS     In anticipation of losing millions from their budgets to help cope with the state's budget crisis, public schools in Broward and Miami-Dade counties are considering significant and painful spending cuts. In both cases, however, administrators are taking sensible approaches that target nonessential programs while protecting basic education.

I assume right now, florida agriculture community is biggest opponent of 
this.  if that assumption is correct, i would suggest doing a separate short 
paragraph to address the governor's intention to advocate for terms that 
will protect florida growers against unfair trade practices such as dumping, 
etc.  or, even better, is there anything we can say now, such as the 
president has assured us that they will vigorously protect against unfair 
trade practices.  i don't know what conversations we have had with 
administration on this. 

by way of history, Clinton promised to protect florida growers from dumping 
as part of their "look the other way" support on NAFTA.  Clinton then did 
little to help once the dumping began.  Growers are weary of similar 
overtures from new administration and similar failure to follow through.  we 
need to assure them that this is not the Clinton admininstration and that 
they will take dumping and other unfair trade practices very seriously.

Congressman Putnam just called.  He heard from NAM (National Assoc of Mfgs) 
that you would be sending a letter to the Delegation urging support for the 
passage of the Trade Promotion Authority legislation (TPA).  This is 
something Pam and Tony Villamil have been working on.  We are re-drafting 
the letter after discussions with Pam and should have it to you by COB 
tomorrow. 

The House vote is scheduled for next Thursday (12/6) and Mr. Putnam wanted 
to pass on his concerns over Florida's agricultural issues.  He wanted to 
make sure we're on the same song sheet. 

More tomorrow.  Nina.

Mrs. Berger,
 
While I agree with most everything your e-mail contained, I must defend my position and responses to a certain degree. Yes you have spoken with me as stated, yes I do feel that your involvement DID influence to Sheriff to FINALLY investigate  the "pavillion" matter. In fact, the Gibbs family moved out last week end, most likely due to this pressure. However, as far as my own personal harassment by the Sheriff and now the County still continues daily as in :
TODAY - 2 PM a code enforcement officer came to my home , told me I did not have an occupational license, refused to look at the license I attempted to show him, threatened to take me to court, and finally said I assulted him, called the Sheriff and now I wait to see if the State's Attorney files 3rd Degree Felony charges against me for this phony stunt. This is not all .... since last we spoke I have been followed by Sheriff vehicles at close range (10 ft) for 4-5 miles, disregarding those who passed us at speeds beyond the posted limit, just to harass me. My phone is suspect to an illegal wire tap, the Sheriff's dept. spends a lot of time here on occasion, but they do so to question people coming and going if "they are happy with the Sheriff's Dept visibility, and are they happy with their Crime Watch Chairman" .... ME ! This hardly constitutes stepped up patrols. They told one newspaper that my whole reason for doing this was because I did not like children AND I am running for an office and there's Much More. I called you after T'giving but got no response. I am under fire & I need help...  When there's no response, I tend to think the worst. I got your e-mail Sunday nite. I called McLaughlin both Monday & today, and left messages. No Response yet. It's hard to have faith in anyone if they don't call you back, especially when you are faced with these types of problems, just for trying to clean up your community.
I hope to hear from you. Just keep in mind, each day is quite an event for me! I am under attack by those who claim to serve our communitys' best interest. The Sheriff lied to you, harasses me and this community, and we cannot get it stopped. It's not easy to be patient with all this going on.

The latest news in education from The Center for Education Reform, http://www.edreform.com. 

CER NEWSWIRE 
Vol. 3, No. 47 
December 4, 2001 
__________________________________________ 
* CHARTERS: San Francisco area charters are holding their first symposium to educate the public about their schools and the role they play in bringing genuine education reform to their community. State Board of Education president Reed Hastings and Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown will address the crowd, and school directors will be on hand to answer questions. 

If you're in the area, the event is being held at the Delancy Street Foundation at 600 Embarcadero Street, from 7-9 p.m. Email garyllarson@hotmail.com for more info.

Indianapolis holds great promise for reform as Mayor Bart Peterson's review panel recommends the city's first four charter schools for approval, including two grassroots organizations and two charters partnered with private companies. The move comes just a few days after a rancorous crowd of school district superintendents demanded the legislature put a moratorium on any charters until the state can guarantee  what seems to most people an outrageous demand  that they won't lose money in their districts just because children decide to go to a charter school.

The suggestion that districts should receive money for children they don't educate is foolish, and the district's claims of financial woe might be better targeted toward school improvements and savings. But they fear that given the chance to leave their schools for another choice, many will, which should immediately raise a red flag to any good tax paying Hoosier who thought their money paid for education, not systems. The good news is that the state's legislative leaders of both parties, the governor and even their Washington representatives are wholeheartedly in favor of the charter reform model for public education. 

Go to http://www.projecte.org for more info. 

* TEACHING: Joining the chorus of advocates for alternative certification, the Progressive Policy Institute hosted a forum in Washington last week, where Dr. Rick Hess from the University of Virginia presented his paper, "Tear Down this Wall: The Case for a Radical Overhaul of Teacher Certification." Hess says a new way of recruiting a more expansive pool of talented, qualified individuals to teach our nation's children is necessary. All candidates should possess a college degree, demonstrate mastery of skills on content knowledge exams, and complete a criminal background check. After that, districts should be free to choose qualified individuals. Hess' proposal was applauded by Teach for America president Wendy Kopp, but mildly objected to by David Imig of the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education and a representative of the school employees union. The AFT rep made little effort to hide her disgust of Hess' new model. 

For the full report, go to: http://www.ppionline.org/documents/teacher_certification.pdf 

* URBAN SCHOOL REFORM: Pennsylvania's plan to take over the Philly schools and allow performance-based contracts with private groups to help turn around the schools has been put on hold until December 21. Those who have a stake in the status quo have turned out to bitterly protest. Meanwhile in Kansas City, sources from the State Board of Education hinted that continued failure to meet performance standards could result in the splitting the district into smaller districts, turning it into a charter district, or a combination of both.

* ACHIEVEMENT: And in case it isn't clear what the fuss is all about in these communities, more evidence of American public education's continued mediocrity comes from another international evaluation of 32 industrialized countries. America's 15-year-olds perform at average levels compared to international peers in demonstrating the ability to apply reading, math and science to real-life situations. Experts have long argued as to the cause of this mediocrity, saying that the application of real learning can come only when students' knowledge is well-ingrained; deep not just wide. Finland, Canada and New Zealand scored above the U.S. in reading. In math, Japan and Korea were among the eight countries scoring higher than the U.S., with five nations significantly below. Other key findings and more details can be found at http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-000096433dec04.story?coll=la%2Dnews%2Da%5Fsection

Brian----accepted change and contacted Terri Rhodes, Martha and Jay.  They 
are looking at it now.  I need to leave the office around 7 pm tonight. 
They might get back to me tonight...if not I told them it has to be first 
thing tomorrow.  The vote is on Thursday; we really need to fast forward if 
we're going to send out. 

You do know that Commissioner Bronson is opposed and has been working the 
Delegation.  In fact the Farm Bureau is having their Christmas party tonight 
and Bronson's staff is up here.  We stressed that the letter strongly states 
the importance of the Florida Ag community and that the Governor would do 
"everything possible to advocate and ensure..." 

They are very appreciative and understand that the Governor is facing 
significant pressures.  They will be back to us soon, I hope. 

Nina.

There were no representatves of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers. The 
groups represented were the Farmworker Self-Help Inc. (Pasco) , Farmworker 
Association of Florida (Apopka) and the United Farm Workers of America 
(Quincy). However, these 3 groups (plus the Coalition) have joined together 
to form the 'Farmworkers United for Justice', a group to serve as a 
collective lobby for all of them.

Dear Mr. President:
 
My husband and I are commercial oyster harvesters born and raised in Franklin County, Florida.  We harvest oysters on the Apalachicola Bay, and we have been stricken with drought conditions, small craft advisories and red tide for the past two and a half months.  Due to these extreme conditions we have unable to work because of bay closures, high winds and slack sales of our product due to bad press.  Small portions of our bay have recently been opened for harvest but sales have drastically been reduced due to unfavorable press releases thus customers fear of our product.  
Governor Bush has declared our county a financial disaster, which brought in little true financial assistance to the seafood workers of this area.  The only thing that I could find that would actually assist some in our community was SBA loans, but when the bay closes again for harvest that will be another bill we will not be able to pay added to the ones we already have. 
I applied for financial assistance on November 22, 2001 and yet to get an appointment.  I have given the HRS my life history and still they want more paper work. Forgive me for being nave to the system but this is my first time asking for any state assistance.  I was under the impression that when you apply for assistance after a disaster was declared you would get assistance before the next year.  I have qualified for food stamps but no financial aid for my bills that are now due.   I had to borrow money in order for my bills to be up to date last month- and now they are due again.  This was a loan, not an income; it will have to be paid back, but thats not how HRS saw it.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
I have written to Governor Bush in formal letters and informally through email and yet to get a reply from him or his office.  I have also sent carbon copies to all my elected state officials and only one has responded to my pleas for help. Will Kendrick is our State Representative and he is the only person to acknowledge me in anyway.  I have spoken with him many times in reference to this issue and he is very concerned about our area.
He is only one person and he can only do so much alone.  We need your help!

Im attaching the letters I have written to the Governor and also the ones that I have written to Mr. Kendrick.  If there are any questions please feel free to call me anytime. 
 
Sincerely,
 
Sandra Allen

We are, however, planning a press release with all of the particulars on the trailer for end of this week.

Rebecca/Fla Film Office has a cool opportunity  -=- hang wiht me here.
She is launching her state wide trailer buy in theaters starting next week around the launch of Oceans 11 on December 7th.
 
We were thinking it might be a cool event to have Gov and Mrs. Bush go to movie theater and do a press avail outside theater, before they go to movie (oceans 11/filmed in fla), applauding purpose of trailer to benefit industry.  There is a statewide buy, minimal buy in tally.

I assume right now, florida agriculture community is biggest opponent of 
this.  if that assumption is correct, i would suggest doing a separate short 
paragraph to address the governor's intention to advocate for terms that 
will protect florida growers against unfair trade practices such as dumping, 
etc.  or, even better, is there anything we can say now, such as the 
president has assured us that they will vigorously protect against unfair 
trade practices.  i don't know what conversations we have had with 
administration on this. 

by way of history, Clinton promised to protect florida growers from dumping 
as part of their "look the other way" support on NAFTA.  Clinton then did 
little to help once the dumping began.  Growers are weary of similar 
overtures from new administration and similar failure to follow through.  we 
need to assure them that this is not the Clinton admininstration and that 
they will take dumping and other unfair trade practices very seriously.

no and 2 are solidly against; 3 are unknown.  Across the board, WH does not

I feel that acknowledging the ag issue in a "sensitive manner" in the letter 
would say a lot.  (We need to be in touch with our female side :-) on this 
one.)  But, it's a huge vote and your letter would be very important, 
they're counting votes...it's that close.  Melissa is drafting...let's see 
how it comes out and I'll send up a copy for consideration and decision.

Congressman Putnam just called.  He heard from NAM (National Assoc of Mfgs) 
that you would be sending a letter to the Delegation urging support for the 
passage of the Trade Promotion Authority legislation (TPA).  This is 
something Pam and Tony Villamil have been working on.  We are re-drafting 
the letter after discussions with Pam and should have it to you by COB 
tomorrow. 

The House vote is scheduled for next Thursday (12/6) and Mr. Putnam wanted 
to pass on his concerns over Florida's agricultural issues.  He wanted to 
make sure we're on the same song sheet. 

More tomorrow.  Nina.

Dear Governor Bush: 

Just a quick refresher ..this is the third year I have alerted you to Kids 
for Peace Pilgrimage Week which, this year runs all this week, Dec. 3-7. 

Last year, if you recall, the children wrote letters to the President 
suggesting how he could bring peace and reconcile the country after such a 
tortuous election and we sent copies, at your request, to you. You were kind 
enough to send a handwritten note which meant a lot to the children. 

I have just heard your brother today suggesting that Americans pray that God 
will put a protective shield over America. He should know that there are 71 
Kids for Peace Schools throughout the nation praying...somewhere between 35 
and 40,000 children. They are also selling a bumper sticker created by a 5 
year old which reads "Peace, please! Do it for us kids - Tommy". The profits 
are being sent to the President's Afghan children's fund. 

Florida once again leads the nation in little peace pilgrims...some 20,000 in 
this state alone, with Pennsylvania second and Texas a distant third. 

Schools were urged to invite you to one of their events this week. I hope 
they did as seeing is believing. My husband, who served with your father in 
Congress and has seen a great deal, said he was "overwhelmed" by a pilgrimage 
he attended in Miami. Mrs. Don Shula who is on our board is greatly 
responsible for 26 schools in Miami-Dade county becoming Kids for Peace 
schools. 

If you wish to follow the week through the Internet, please visit our 
website..www.peacethroughlove.org and click on FrontPageNews 

Bill and I send best regards to your Mom and Dad. Your brother is in our 
prayers everyday. 

Peace!

Subject:	Drug Treatment Initiative Oral Argument on 12/10/01

Governor: 

As you know, we filed a brief in the Fla. Supreme Court on your behalf 
opposing the drug treatment initiative.  Oral argument is scheduled for 
Monday, Dec. 10 at 9:00 a.m.  We requested oral argument when the brief was 
filed in order to preserve the opportunity.  However, four of the five 
parties opposing the initiative -- including the EOG -- are scheduled to 
argue and have been alotted 5 minutes each.  The other parties' briefs -- 
especially that of Save Our Society from Drugs -- largely cover the same 
territory covered in our brief, although they make additional arguments, as 
well.  Because of the overlap, and because FDLE and the Prosecuting 
Attorneys Assn can adequately advance the concerns of the executive branch, 
we propose waiving or yielding our time to the other parties to best utilize 
the time given to the initiative's opponents collectively. 

Please let me know whether you agree or disagree.  Thank you.

Governor:  You asked to be kept up to date, so here is the latest. This is "Project Orbit".  I now have location criteria and project details.  Scheduled to follow up with specific site recommendations Dec 17.  Tentative site evaluation visit Jan. 21 - 22.  Our contact is Russ Lockridge, VP, HR.  Fun guy on the phone.  I mentioned Manny Fernandez (Director, Executive Committee, Chair Corporate Governance committee) ... Russ said he was with him yesterday.  I am not absolutely sure if he (Fernandez) knows about "Orbit", but if he should bring it up to you, put your best sales pitch on him.  [Key criteria: a class A office building (will lease)on the water within a walk to a marina where they can show off 8 to 16 products, in a community with good airport, quality of life and good schools, and incentives are important. Two phases: 1) 50 employees, early next year and 2) additional 150 employees, summer '03]
 
Thanks for your suggestion regarding Struhs call. Good to know the option is there, but will try not to use it.
 
I'll not bother you with too many updates/details unless you are needed, then I won't hesitate. Thanks for the good lead! Steve

Subject: CONFIDENTIAL: Prospect follow up



Regarding the prospect you called me about this morning: 

After researching the company and recent history in Florida, I called the 
contact the CEO gave you. We had a brief conversation before he had to 
leave, but he will get back to me this evening or tomorrow. I also left a 
message for Stu Turley, to let him know you had followed up and see what 
else he could tell me.  

Here's a stroke of luck that we may, if we get the chance, use at the right 
time:  Manny Fernandez (Gartner, UF Trustee) is on the prospects Board, 
their executive committee, and chairs their "Corporate Governance" 
committee. 

Regarding the permitting issues, I spent considerable time getting briefed 
by their local attorneys, Wade Hopping and Gary Hunter. I asked Gary to 
provide me with a written summary of their issues which will probably be 
more accurate than my retelling of the story.  Hopefully, the client will 
allow this, and you can use it to assess the situation.  This is one side of 
the story, and I am sure DEP has a different perspective. 

The permitting problem that I was aware of when you called me had to do with 
the company not getting air permits before they began an expansion about 2 
years ago. They were under the impression that their existing permits would 
be sufficient.  That situation was corrected.  [FYI: this is a "Title V" air 
emission facility....fiberglass emissions are a bit nasty.] 

More recently they have had problems with manatees and US Fish and Wildlife 
and local manatee clubs.  I am told the company has asked for help from your 
office to get US F & W  to respect Florida rules (speed) within the barge 
canal.  This issue has been very difficult for them, and remains a problem. 

But they are really unhappy about the "raid" you mentioned.  And if their 
lawyers account is reasonably accurate, they have every reason to be. 
Apparently a busload of DEP law enforcement officers, complete with flack 
jackets and guns, with press there to witness, descended upon one of their 
plants in response to a caller who alleged they were dumping hazardous 
waste.  DEP reps apparently mentioned to the press, and they reported, that 
this was a "criminal investigation" involving "suspected felonies".  That 
was in February, '01.  My understanding is that prior to the "raid", when 
the company first heard about the allegations, they did their own testing 
(after informing DEP in case they wanted to witness) and found nothing.  And 
apparently DEP didn't either.  The company feels their reputation was 
needlessly damaged and that the whole thing was mishandled.  

So, we have a lot to overcome to convince the CEO to invest more in Florida.

Spoke with Paul.  The House will publish the Margarden and Detert bills 
tonight for first reading.  The bills will be taken up on second reading 
tomorrow.  Tomorrow the House will take up bills in the following order: 
Security, conforming cut bills, Maygarden bill, and finally the Detert bill. 
The House will lay the Detert bill on the table and take up the companion, 
the Pruitt bill.  If possible, they will roll all bills to third reading 
tomorrow and pass them out.  If can't get 2/3's to roll to third, they bill 
pass these bills Thursday.  The Detert deferral bill is closed; no 
amendments will be allowed. 

Spoke to Chairman Goodlette re: capitol security.  Relayed your concerns 
with commission.  He appreciated.  Said this was being driven by Speaker's 
office.  Discussed your concerns with Paul.  No resolution in sight. 

Building codes.  Paul suggests you discuss your concerns with the Speaker. 
He thinks Speaker inclined to accept bill. 

Kid Care: Medicaid bill up in House tomorrow.  I expressed our concern with 
the local match requirements.  He said he would raise with Speaker.  The LG

Subject:	Updates

Governor, 
I wanted to share some information on a few cases that you had referred 
to us: 

We are getting regular payments for a custodial parent in Casselbury 
but we have to continue to seek assistance from Pennsylvania's child 
support agency because the noncustodial parent pays less than 
court-ordered.  The children are over 18 but the father owes more than 
$130,000 in arrears!  The custodial parent knows we're doing all that we 
can and that we will continue with our efforts. 

I'm still plugging away on the case with Ms. Calloway.  It's an 
interesting one.  We've been able to collect over $10,000 on her behalf 
in the last year from court-ordered purges.  The father still won't pay 
on a regular basis but Ms. Calloway knows we are still plugging away... 

On a very good note, one of the cases you referred to us from a mother 
who wrote to you from North Carolina about a year ago reached a 
successful conclusion.  The noncustodial parent paid $15,000 to the 
custodial parent a few weeks ago to pay off all the back child support 
owed.  She was very happy to get this money.  This case is now closed. 

On another note, I know that Jim appreciates your support of the 
Department's proposal to implement an administrative support process. 
Many of the calls and e-mails I receive are from frustrated parents 
waiting for their cases to go to hearing.   Anything that can be done to 
make the establishment process more efficient will improve our level of 
service.  

I wish you and your family a very happy holiday season, 
Karen Kellams

I went over to Flagler Co. yesterday as we discussed. The courthouse will be 
fine, so we will be there on the 14th. The county commission was holding a

Subject: Parent with a question


Dear Governor Bush,
I have corresponded with you many times and am always greatful to your office for an answer to questions I have.
I am not versed in all the avenues that the legislature works, but I am trying to learn.
As I have told you before, I have a child with a disability and he is my center of focus most of the time.
Recently I ran across a Statute in the 1999 Florida Statutes and State board of Education Rules ( exerpts for Special Programs).
The statute is , or was, 236.145, regarding Residential nonpublic school contract reimbursement.  The  interesting part is a School district may be eligible for 60% of the cost of the contract for a disabled child to attend a private school.
Now, as far as I can tell the law was repealed in 2000, under S1770.
When I looked this up to see why, it said the statute was outdated along with many others, and that the Department of Education said the statute is no longer used.
But, I recently received information from the Department of Education stating that there were many counties that have received this 60% reimbursement for disabled children for the year 99-2000.
What can I do as a citizen, if the bill was passed under the pretense of nonuse, when in fact that was not true?
This statute could be very valuable for families that need private placement. Even though the McKay scholarships are around now, which was a wonderful idea, there are not any schools that will accept my child.
I hope you understand my question and can provide me with a direction.
Sincerely, Dawn Taylor

Saving kids by computer 

 St. Petersburg Times, published December 1, 2001 


   Florida children will suffer if lawmakers pull the plug on the state's 
bungled child-welfare computer system instead of insisting on a plan to fix 
it.   Florida lawmakers are right to demand answers about the state's 
child-welfare computer system. The project has been a breathtaking example 
of government bungling -- and that's putting it charitably. But lawmakers 
will only make matters worse if they shut down the project or slash funding 
to the point of crippling it. A lot more than state dollars would be 
wasted. 

   Children's lives may be lost as well. 

   Lawmakers in both Houses met this week to figure out why, after 11 years 
of failed attempts and millions of dollars already invested, the promised 
state-of-the-art tracking system remains far from complete. 

   "In this time of a budget crunch, [when] we're cutting direct services 
to pregnant moms and seniors, we can't be putting millions and millions of 
dollars into a computer program that doesn't show results," an 
understandably frustrated Rep. Nan Rich, D-Weston, told her colleagues on 
the House Child and Family Security Committee. 

   The urge to cut Florida's losses and run might make sense if the new 
computer were not so critical to the state's ability to protect at-risk 
kids. Once fully on-line, it will replace six unconnected and outmoded data 
systems the Department of Children and Families has used, with little 
success, for decades. Instead of rifling through masses of paper resembling 
phone-book yellow pages, DCF workers will be able with a few keystrokes to 
find out and record important information about each child. Investigators 
will know more about the child's history before investigating abuse 
complaints, and workers may better follow kids as they move through the 
system (while supervisors better track caseworkers). At the start of the 
21st century, you might assume the state already had such capabilities, but 
you would be wrong. 

   Until recently, DCF could barely say how many children were in the 
system, much less track the full history and case plan of each. Though DCF 
is in the process of turning over many duties to community-based agencies, 
the new statewide system remains critical, especially since troubled 
families often move from one community to another. 

   Statistics out this week punctuate the need to speed up the conversion. 
Eighty percent of the 60 Florida children who recently died from abuse or 
neglect might have been saved had investigators been more thorough and 
observant, according to the State Child Abuse Death Review Team. The 
automated computer would have helped. 

   "If we could get this done yesterday we would," DCF Chief Information 
Officer Randy Niewenhous, told the Times. "Why? Because this is about 
saving the lives of kids."

been Korea to Japan (We traveled so much it all blends together after 
a bit) when both of us wound up in sick bay together. We looked at 
each other, shook hands and started laughing. He told his doc, Burton 
Lee, to treat me first cause, he said, I looked worse than he did. 
All I know is a few days later I was throwing up myself at about the 
same time he was doing the same thing at the Japanese State dinner in 
his honor. 
I told him later that he at least got to go to sleep that night. I 
had stay up and file a story his fainting spell. That was one 
miserable trip. 
Anyway, Thanks for the help.

NAACP: Lauderdale officials should be fired 
-------------------- 

By Gregory Lewis 
Staff Writer 

November 30, 2001 

The Fort Lauderdale NAACP called for the dismissals of several Fort 
Lauderdale city officials who have been cited in the past for discriminatory 
practices, including the city attorney. 

The Thursday night action was an amendment to a recommendation by the 
national legal team and the local National Association for the Advancement 
of Colored People executive board. 

The members insisted the civil rights organization take a stronger stand by 
asking that city officials be terminated. 

Janice Boursiquot, who was the only member to vote against the 
recommendation as initially presented Thursday got "amens'' from the 
audience as she explained that the action wasn't strong enough. 

"Many people have been damaged by blatant discrimination,'' she said. "Those 
managers caused a lot of pain for a lot of people. It is time for them to 
feel pain." 

The NAACP supported some of the recommendations in a report from Judge Henry 
Latimer. The report found that the city mistreats all of its employees, 
recommended a major restructuring of top management at City Hall and called 
for the expansion of the city's Equal Employment Opportunities office. 

In addition to the firings, the NAACP will ask the city to: 

Employ a full time independent counsel to review and handle complaints of 
discrimination for one year; 

Terminate employees who engage in any illegal employment practices; 

Implement sensitivity training for all city employees; 

Be on alert for retaliatory action against whistleblowers. 

Assistant City Manager Bud Bentley said of the NAACP action: "Overall we're 
happy and pleased the NAACP is taking the interest to look at and advise us 
on the Latimer report." 

But, Bentley said, he was concerned that "specific people" were named when 
the organization hasn't made any determination for cause. 

NAACP state president Adora Obi Nwese encouraged the chapter to take strong 
action saying "we are in a war.'' 

She said she was "sick and tired of being sick and tired'' of institutions 
that "think they can get away with discriminatory treatment and racist 
behavior.'' 

Said Fort Lauderdale chapter president Bill McCormick: "What transpired here 
is the members said they trust the NAACP to fight for us,'' he said.

I am a condominium owner here at the Villager Condominium in Indialantic, 
Florida.   Maybe you saw our plea for help on the Channel 13 News yesterday, 
December 3rd.  Our beach erosion is only 29 feet from our 13 story building 
and in serious danger of being condemned if the water reaches us.  There are 
97 families here in our building and many are elderly people with their lives 
tied to this place. 

We have been denied emergency aid and funds and we where told that it won't 
be until the year 2002 before funds are available to us.  WE CANNOT WAIT !  
Our lifetime investment will be in the ocean by then and it will be the 
governments fault for not stepping up and taking on their responsibility.  
PLEASE hear our plea's!    We need Emergency funds NOW to save our building.  
You are our lifeline, so won't you please help us.   You and your political 
affiliation will not be forgotten by us.  We are a strong united group of 
registered voters that will be watching to see how you and our government 
reacts to our pleas for help.

I assume right now, florida agriculture community is biggest opponent of 
this.  if that assumption is correct, i would suggest doing a separate short 
paragraph to address the governor's intention to advocate for terms that 
will protect florida growers against unfair trade practices such as dumping, 
etc.  or, even better, is there anything we can say now, such as the 
president has assured us that they will vigorously protect against unfair 
trade practices.  i don't know what conversations we have had with 
administration on this. 

by way of history, Clinton promised to protect florida growers from dumping 
as part of their "look the other way" support on NAFTA.  Clinton then did 
little to help once the dumping began.  Growers are weary of similar 
overtures from new administration and similar failure to follow through.  we 
need to assure them that this is not the Clinton admininstration and that 
they will take dumping and other unfair trade practices very seriously.

I feel that acknowledging the ag issue in a "sensitive manner" in the letter

Congressman Putnam just called.  He heard from NAM (National Assoc of Mfgs) 
that you would be sending a letter to the Delegation urging support for the 
passage of the Trade Promotion Authority legislation (TPA).  This is 
something Pam and Tony Villamil have been working on.  We are re-drafting 
the letter after discussions with Pam and should have it to you by COB 
tomorrow.

Jeb, 
Your new "big brother" prescription drug program is a typical stupid 
government policy.  The only thing this will accomplish is to increase 
the suffering of the people that actually need the pain killing drugs. 
Such "big brother" legislation only scares doctors from prescribing 
needed medication because they don't want to be possible "victims" of 
overzealous "drug cops".  Thus the only doctors that will prescribe 
effective pain medications will be the "pain specialists".  You are 
probably not aware of the "pain specialist" racket but the net effect is 
that the cost is so high that most uninsured patients choose to suffer 
or go to the black market to get pain medication.  I'm sure your 
brilliant program will cause a huge increase in marijuana usage.  It's 
called the law of unintended consequences.  The stupidity of this new 
government program is unbelievable. But I guess you are pandering as 
usual!

Welfare computer funds in peril 
By Mark Hollis 
Tallahassee Bureau 
Posted November 28 2001 

TALLAHASSEE  State legislators are asking why Florida government has 
spent 
11 years and more than $230 million but still hasn't finished building a 
state-of-the-art child welfare computer system. 

Incensed by repeated delays and cost overruns in developing the giant 
database, members of a House panel on Tuesday warned that if they don't 
see 
progress, they might halt spending on the program. 

"I want to reduce the funding level," said Rep. Nan Rich, a Weston 
Democrat. 
"In this time of a budget crunch and we're cutting direct services to 
pregnant moms and seniors, we can't be putting millions and millions of 
dollars into a computer program that doesn't show results." 

Republican budget writers also called for immediate accountability 
measures 
and threatened budget cuts. 

"We want to see a decrease in child abuse -- that's the bottom line," 
Rep. 
Sandra Murman, R-Tampa, said of her expectations for the system. 

Responding to a story in Sunday's Sun-Sentinel, legislators questioned 
why 
the state recently replaced three of the project's top managers, who 
combined made about $700,000 a year, with a three-member team from IBM 
at a 
cost of $1.8 million a year. 

Rep. Nancy Detert, R-Venice, chairwoman of the Child and Family Security 
Committee, also described as excessive a projected $22.5 million-a-year 
cost 
of maintaining the completed system. 

The electronic system will replace a patchwork of paper files and a half 
dozen other computer systems. 

It is supposed to allow workers instant access to all information about 
abused and neglected children in Florida and thousands of foster-care 
families. 

Because of repeated delays, management turnover and other problems, the 
completion date for the project, originally set for 1998, has been 
pushed to 
2005. 

"In the time and money that's been spent, we could have done EPCOT and 
Disney World both," Detert said. 

Department of Children and Families officials insisted that the project 
is 
extremely valuable to case workers and that they have made extraordinary 
progress in getting the system set up -- at least in its early phases -- 
since Gov. Jeb Bush took office. They said the first phase of the 
project 
has been in operation since summer. 

DCF Secretary Kathleen Kearney, a former judge in Broward County, said 
that 
when she took office in 1998 the state had accomplished little more than 
having purchased some of the computers. 

"We've taken a phoenix and risen it from the ashes," Kearney said. 

Yet Kearney said she recognizes public dissatisfaction with the project. 

Murman questioned the purpose of developing such a centralized computer 
system when the state is decentralizing social services functions and 
turning over responsibilities to local agencies and nonprofit 
organizations. 

"Philosophically," Murman said, "something is wrong with that system."

Jeb, 

    At one time I owned several hundred thousand square feet of office space here in Tallahassee that I leased to a variety of folks, including various state agencies. I  no longer own any space. I never understood why the state owned office buildings, and I would like to visit with you on forming a Task Force to look into this matter. I would hope there is substantial equity in these buildings above and beyond the Bonds outstanding that we could use for good purposes. Many obstacles need to be overcome, but do you have an interest in pursuing this? I think the climate is right in the House and if the Task Force ( or whatever ) arrives at the conclusion I think it will the Senate should go along.


    At your earliest convenience please let me know your thoughts. 


    Thanks, Jeb.

we don't usually place messages of this sort on the site.  Don't think we

Jeb,
 
We met briefly on your trip to Silicon Valley with Enterprise Florida this year.   Hope things are well in Florida.  I am a partner at Hummer Winblad Venture Partners, was the former Navy fighter pilot, US Naval Academy graduate, served in Jacksonville Florida, started UnheardSoldier effort last December related to military ballots.
 
Realize your time is at absolute premium but wanted to make you aware of another effort I kickstarted but now has life of its own.  We are aggregating high profile support / board involvement as we speak.  Would like to get your input on a few fronts so let me explain some detail.
 
Immediately after Sept. 11th events, I started organizing a national bicycle ride called UnitedWeRide  <http://www.unitedweride.org/> www.unitedweride.org 501(c)(3) with mission statement / charter to assist families impacted by terrorism, and also create national participatory tribute to those lost that day.  Originally was going to be grassroots effort but response was incredible so shifted quickly to larger, organized, professional event.  
 
The format, plan is to have bicycle riders leave from several major cities next summer (San Fran, Seattle, Los Angeles, Denver, Austin, Miami, Atlanta, Chicago, Boston) and ride through cities large / small, routes pass through Oklahoma City, United Airlines Flight 93 crash site, Arlington National Cemetery, the Pentagon, Gettysburg, Liberty Bell, and all routes will converge at Ground Zero weekend of Aug 3-4, 2002 in New York City.  All 50 states to participate, plan to get Governor support within each state for permits / routes.  
 
We also plan to have select riders carry a memorial stone for each individual lost in war on terrorism (this would include Sept. 11th, but also other losses, Anthrax, servicemen and women lost in battle, leading up to next summer).  I have approached the families of some friends lost about this, and the families of some of the passengers from UA Flight 93 to get their perspective / support.  And also to get sense of whether they would have an interest in getting a particular family member / team together to "carry", in tributary, honor guard fashion, their individual memorial (which some very much do, all are supportive of effort).
 
UnitedWeRide has the event planning group that put on 1996 Olympic bike events, San Francisco Grand Prix supporting this, and we are putting A+ support structure in place to pull this off.  So far response has been overwhelming.  New York City said they would 'open their arms' to this next August.  Lance Armstrong, Tour de France winner 3 years running, will be part of final ride weekend.  Plan to make formal press announcement by end of year.
 
We are also approaching individuals to present a world class Board / Honorary Chairperson in major cities represented in the ride (some high profile personalities that represent all that is great about USA).  Board member commitment no more than 3-4 Board meetings leading up to next summer, Honorary Chairperson will be personality in particular city that will show up and kick off ride that day in that city.  We are approaching Astronaut Jim Lovell and retired General Norman Schwarzkopf for example as well as leaders in industry to participate.  
 
Would like to get your input on someone you think would be Honorary Chairperson for the City of Miami, a key origination city.  And your input as Governor on the overall effort.  It would be great to get a state Governor champion to support and help rally the nation's Governors behind UnitedWeRide.
 
I know the President is too busy to focus on this, but we are approaching Lee Haney, the current Chairman of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, to determine if there is interest in supporting, being involved in UnitedWeRide.
 
(btw, I have no personal interest in recognition, etc., from this...none.  This is for the country and the families.  It is already shaping up that the existing supporting cast, high profile folks will take center stage and I can fade into background.)
 
UnitedWeRide is already an official corporation.  Right now there are core groups in New York and Silicon Valley that are helping this move forward.  This may be the largest cycling event / peacetime domestic sporting event in history if the event planning projections play out.
 
Do you have 5 minutes to discuss / any initial reaction to the event itself or suggesting on who best to represent Miami?  Happy to discuss with appropriate person / staff when able and provide more details.

Regards,

Dan

Dear Jeb,
 
As much as I was exited about the A.B.L.E Foundation, now I feel like something is wrong. I don't like that ticket system and
I am NOT going to give personnal information like address or phone number to them. I know nothing about them. Another thing
that I noticed was "we have the SYSTEM for funding", that doesn't mean that they have the actual funds.
I feel like there is too much volunterism in this, nobody works that much for free.
Never mind the RSVP, I understand that. One of my friend who works in Greta's school mentionned to me something about
"Scientology" I had no clue that it existed.
What I am asking now is to have someone check on this. I hope my feelings are wrong. I have dreams but I am pretty down to Earth.
 
Sincerely,
 
Beatrice

Hi Beatrice -
 
GREAT!  We'll mark January 15, 2002 on the calendar for the Osceola A.B.L.E. Center introductory meeting!  You may want to be gathering the list of contact names, addresses, phone #'s, email addresses, etc. so that once the official announcement is made December 25, we can notify them of the 1/15/02 meeting.
 
Regarding the entrance ticket:  there are many people who, for various reasons, attempt to tear down or destroy good things.  Some people act that way out of jealousy, low self-esteem, retaliation, etc.  Some people simply fail to understand the true meaning of things and then spread gossip, or simply the wrong information.  It's like the telephone game we would play as children, when a sentence is whispered in the ear of the first person and then passed on to the next person, and so on around the circle.  By the time the last person received the whispered message and spoke it out loud, it was completely changed around and different than when it started!  We must protect the people who will be served and benefit from the programs at the A.B.L.E. Center.  One of the ways to do so is to share the A.B.L.E. Vision with the people who will benefit directly or who will be involved with the development of the Center.   
 
When we make the announcement throughout the organizations, agencies, media, etc. throughout the community, those interested in attending MUST R.S.V.P. and will be provided either an email confirmation that is numbered, or will receive their confirmation number by US mail or telephone.  They will simply provide their confirmation number and name at the door of the meeting.  It's very easy to do and helps us provide security and privacy of the information provided at the meeting.  When people share information about themselves and their family situation or child with a disability, they need to know that there aren't people in the room who would use that information to harm them.  Believe me, this has happened to other organizations, and we don't want it to happen to us.  
 
There is no charge to attend the meeting and learn about the A.B.L.E. Vision.  With the state of Florida experiencing so many funding cutbacks, people are desperate to receive services for their children, and it is extremely important that we are organized and know the people we are working with and are meeting at the meetings.  You'll see what I mean about why this is so important as we get further along.  
 
The A.B.L.E. Centers are open to Members only.  Membership is free and open to the public, and no one is denied the opportunity to become a member of the A.B.L.E. Network.  Again, you'll understand more about this as we go along.  It is to protect and serve the people better.  We are looking for winners, not whiners.\
 
The communities will be building the actual center!  The communities will be very involved in all areas of the development and construction of the actual Center!  It is like an old-fashioned community barn raising!  In the process of the development and construction of the A.B.L.E. Centers we will be changing the way society views and treats people with disabilities.  We will be educating the community at the same time!  For the most part, communities shun people with disabilities.  Just look around - parades, community functions, etc., do not promote the incorporation of people with disabilities.  We have activities that promote inclusion and embrace the true spirit of cooperation and community.
 
There is so much information to share with you.  You may want to be looking for people who have leadership qualities such as you do.  These talents are truly gifts from God!  You'll want to find 6-8 leaders with the talents and time to devote to the project.  We are all volunteers serving our community.  Once the Center is open, there will, no doubt, be some of these volunteers who will want to be employed at the A.B.L.E. Center.  
 
Basically, Beatrice - what programs and services would you want for your child (of any age) with a disability and for your family if money were of no concern?  Think about the future.  Dream big ~ our children deserve no less than the best life has to offer.  The best of your dreams is what the A.B.L.E. Centers will offer!  We will serve the needs of children and adults with disabilities and their families - whatever those needs may be.  We help them to help themselves - long term.  We are not a hand-out, but rather, a hand up.
 
We will be working with each family with a child with a disability to help them achieve beyond limited expectations society places upon them.  You may want to encourage people to reach out to families with a child with a disability who they never took the time to meet or get to know yet.  Just think how many more people we can reach if each family with a special needs child reached out to one new family each week.  Just think how quickly we would be able to touch the hearts of families who didn't know who to go to for help, to get their questions answered, who thought no one else understood what they are going through, or who thought no one else in the community cared.  Parents of children with disabilities have so much knowledge and experience that we must reach out and share it with younger families to help them avoid some of the problems, frustrations, and concerns we had and stuggled through.  Our mission is to help children and adults with disabilities achieve beyond limited expectations - one family at a time!
 
Sorry to write such a long email!  There is so much excitement to share!
 
Warm regards,
Lori Bennett
Ambassador of Hope

Hello again Lori,
 
The 15th of January will be fine to introduce the A.B.L.E Center. Tomorrow, I will get with Eleanor or Mary Beth from the Agriculture
Center and find a bigger place for that meeting.
I would like to know more about the A.B.L.E vision to focus my thoughts on what we need, what do you have in mind when
you wrote "The communities will be building the actual center!  ".
Can you explain a little more about the entrance ticket for the meeting?
 
SIncerely
 
Beatrice

Good morning Beatrice -
 
I am so excited ready your email!  I can't wait to talk with you more about the A.B.L.E. Center for Osceola County.  As you can imagine, we need to keep this hush-hush for now because it is not fair to other communities.  But, you can definitely start thinking about "your" center!  We would like for you to be one of the leaders of the A.B.L.E. Center in Osceola county.  Your dreams of opening a special center for disabled people will now come true!  We have the system for funding, we have the organization, we have the resources to make the dream a reality.  There is a special group of philapthropists who wish to remain anonymous, who are providing the seed money for the 12 Centers.  This is such an awesome opportunity, Beatrice, and can you just imagine the impact we will have on each community and the lives of children and adults with disabilities and their families!  No longer will they be at the mercy of anyone else to provide for their needs.  No longer will they have to beg for services, programs, and funding for their needs.  
 
What town do you live in?  Our family is in Levy county which is just south west of Ganiesville and west of Ocala - it's about 1 1/2 to 2 hours from Orlando.  Our oldest 2 sons live in Orlando with their families.  We are so blessed to have them close by to visit with them often.  In fact, we just threw a surprise Sweet 16 birthday party for our son, Jonathan's girlfriend, Chantelle.  She was soooo surprised and it was a big success. She is such a sweet girl and her mom is an ESE teacher for the local high school.  
 
Thanks for the survey list.  You do have a lot of contacts and connections.  This is vital to the success of the A.B.L.E. Centers in each community.  The communities will be building the actual center!  Would you like to plan on January 15 for us to make the introduction to the community about the Osceola County A.B.L.E. Center?  We will have to hold the meeting in a place that will be able to accomodate many people as we expect a large turnout.  The meeting will be by invitation only and people MUST R.S.V.P. to receive their entrance ticket.
 
We'll talk more about the January meeting, if that is what you would like to do for that meeting.  Let me know if this is agreeable to you, and possible places to hold the meeting.
 
Warm regards,
Lori

Dear Governor Bush, 

I am disappointed, even appalled, that our fine state is going ahead with 
plans for the Ichetucknee Cement Plant.  You campaigned on being a regular 
guy, with Hispanic ties, someone who understands Florida and Floridians. 
Well this is your one chance to prove it, clearly and convincingly.  

Please oppose the Ichetucknee Cement Plant.  There is no doubt that the 
Ichetucknee Cement Plant will cause harm to the Ichetucknee River.  The 
Ichetucknee River is the best place I have ever visited.  I love it there 
and day dream about it n I need to relax.  The Ichetucknee Cement Plant will 
pollute the entire area and those pollutants will leach into the ground 
water in the immediate area and ruin the Ichetucknee River.  You know it's 
true, so stop the plant. 

Thanks for your commitment to Florida.  My children will be blessed with a 
clean river for years to come thanks to your support. 

Sincerely, Joe Kahl

Subject:        Background info on OxyContin legislation package to be announced in Orlando tomorrow
Greg,
Per your request, here are some bullets regarding the process by which this legislation was developed:
(OxyContin is a breakthrough chronic pain management medicine developed by Purdue Pharma, with an explosion in use of product from its intro in 1996 - see attached sales graph in Tab 6 of accompanying Goldenrod handout)
1) The impetus for legislation was: a) a dramatic, sharp spike in overdose deaths reported in state since Summer, 2000; b) OxyContin abuse is a phenomenon largely driven through prescription fraud by addicts and a few bad doctors violating legal and ethical codes by grossly over prescribing these drugs - either deliberately, in a willfully ignorant manner, or in simple ignorance of proper pain management practices; and finally C) the seemingly lethargic ability of the Board of Medicine to shut down these bad doctors.
2)  Office of Drug Control, with SEN Burt providing support for any resultant legislation, initiated an broad effort to turn this problem around.
It has attempted to do this by:
        A) receiving a comprehensive brief from the Board of Medicine's Quality Assurance Committee in the early August on what the disciplinary process is for doctors accused of malfeasance and/or nonfeasance; and getting commitments from the group to be part of the process to make improvements so as to avoid the horror stories this Office has been made aware of, of bad doctor abuses occurring around the state; setting stage for recognition  by the medical community that more must be done to "police its own" in a more effective manner
        B) making OxyContin abuse a priority of the Drug Policy Advisory Council meeting in Tampa on 27 August, with the Council fully supporting a comprehensive fix to long standing problems in how the prescription drug system functions in Florida, and the underlying problems with chronic pain management;  this then reinforced the public hearing process.
        C) Board of Medicine convened a series of open hearings on the problem around the state in late summer and fall to vette the various recommendations pouring forth from the medical and law enforcement communities on fixing this problem.  The Bd. of Medicine has been very proactive in this regard; FDLE, AHCA, and DOH have all also stepped up to the plate to help design an effective piece of legislation.
No doubt, the medical community - to include especially the FMA, Bd. of Pharmacists, and the Nurses Assoc. - and others I can't remember off the top of my head - also all wanted to participate in this process, and did so. In conversation I had with their reps., it was clear they wanted to be intimately involved in this effort, so as to not have overly onerous rules/laws foisted on them  - and they were by being full participants.
I myself represented this Office at the first meeting in Ft. Lauderdale on 29 August, attended by all of the above, plus SEN Burt and AG Butterworth. Ideas were discussed, tabled for review for legal sufficiency, common sense checks.
        BOTTOM LINE:  This legislation pulls no punches, and has been developed with the participation of all of the above groups.  I do not know how many have seen the text, but the three bills incorporate many of the 61 suggestions adopted through the Bd. of Medicine's hearing process.  The substantive bill is the crux, with many ideas put forward - such as tamper proof prescription pads - which have been in effect for many years in other states.  I can think of nothing in the legislation that is "revolutionary" or which is not currently in practice in some other state.
The Electronic database is accompanied by a public records exemption bill to assuage the civil liberties concerns with centralized medical database repositories being maintained by the state.  Finally, Criminal penalties have been strongly pushed by SEN Burt, and are a good response to the horror stories these various public hearings brought to light from law enforcement, concerned health care practitioners, and people who have lost loved ones to Oxy ODs.
 
Technical questions raised by Governor on bullet four as to which specific violations are meant I'm still waiting for an answer from author of that portion.

Subject:	Sex offender legislation research
Attachments:	summary sheet repeat sexual offenders.doc


Governor, 

Per your direction, here is the research we have compiled on the proposal to require mandatory sentences of 25 years to life for offenders who are convicted of a second, significant sexual felony. The latest bill draft would not affect any first-time offenders.

The data demonstrates that it is the repeat offenders who are most likely to be referred and committed. Although repeat offenders comprise 40% of those referred to the Dept. of Children and Families, 61% of those referrals are sent to the state attorneys for further action. The bottom line is that 71% of those committed have multiple offenses, while only 17% have a single offense. [Only 7% have a single offense if juvenile records are considered.]

The proposed draft utilizes the reformed chapter on lewd/lascivious crimes that better recognizes the severity of certain crimes. 

No proposal can guarantee that we won't capture some offenders who would not have been referred and committed. This proposal, however, is limited to repeat offenders who are convicted of at least two serious sexual felonies.  

Please let me know if I can provide more information. 

  


*	40% of persons referred to the Department and Children and Family Services for evaluation have multiple sexual offense convictions.
*	61% of cases referred to the Office of the State Attorney by the multi-disciplinary team had multiple sex offense convictions.
*	71% of committed violent sexual predators had multiple convictions. 
*	Only 17 % of sexually violent predator had a single count conviction ultimately resulting in commitment.  
*	When juvenile sex offense records are considered as prior criminal records, sexual predators with a single count sex offense conviction comprise 7% of the committed population. 
*	72% of the cases referred for evaluation and rejected by Department of Children and Family Services for further consideration, had single sex offense convictions.


The PSU proposal excludes certain "less severe (comparatively speaking)" felony sex offenses from the mandatory such as felony pornography possession/distribution charges and lewd and lascivious exposure in the presence of a child. However, it would apply to all sexual battery offenses and lewd and lascivious molestation or battery (which is the greatest contributing offense to this population).  The proposal cannot guarantee the prolonged incarceration of everyone who would be Ryce-bound. It also may provide for prolonged incarceration of those who might not have ultimately been Ryced. Be that as it may, it represents the best determination to pre-identify this population and should for the most part do just that (as indicated above).

i want to bring to your attention to the direction (what i know is mostly rumor) that the p rule is heading.   dep had some meetings (operated by some consultants) with "interested parties" and many presentations were made and there was lots of discussion.  
 
we (wellington) had requested one more meeting for everyone to describe what technology (s) could bring us to standard,  but that did not happen.   
 
it seems that we are heading for a standard of 10 (wellington is not really interested in arguing this) and how the standard is measured (and wellington has no choice but to be interested in this aspect)  we made a presentation to the consultants and other parties and brought forward all the unresolved issues that have an impact on the urban areas (such things as by-pass water, where and how to measure, stuff like that) and what seems to be coming out is a system of "variances" which i believe will cause major heartburn.
 
i think dep as labored hard on this issue and doing everything i can do to make sure we do not embrace you or ourselves in the process............................   somehow i think this one ends up on your desk.

Honorable Governor Bush, 

Our County Park is under siege by the political games played in Dade County. 
The Parks Department along with the Honorable Gwen Margolis have 
orchestrated a plan to commercialize Haulover Park in Dade County. The park 
is bordered by the ocean and Intercoastal and provides access to many 
minority groups living west of Biscayne Boulevard. I solicited their 
comments through a public awareness campaign held on Labor Day. Their 
suggestions were that the county should concentrate their efforts on better 
bathrooms, sand boxes for the kids, picnic tables and more. They are not 
aware of the assault on their access through increased parking concessions, 
privatized dock space that will destroy the breathtaking views of the 
intercoastal, and an overall commercialization of the Park. 

The FDEP West Palm Beach, recently denied an application for an expansion of 
the dock facility that presently houses a GAMING vessel, which was in the 
park ILLEGALLY, and authorized by the county. 

I ask you to further review, contest, and revoke an existing permit that 
allows the county to expand the Marina additionally for private use with 
over 150 new slips for rent, a 350' intrusion into the intercoastal, 300 
yard driving range with a 60' net, and other commercial operations at the 
park. These proposed changes do not serve the PUBLIC interest and 
generations to come will suffer if their allowed to proceed unchecked. 

Please Help

The computer software modifications we began in mid-November to accomplish this procedural change have just been completed.  The first test of this rollout began yesterday at our Pembroke Pines driver license office and all went well.  We will phase-in all other driver license offices over the next two weeks and anticipate completing the rollout by December 15, 2001.

 We have 5 applications.  One with no financial information to submit (VA 
nursing home), three being reviewed to determine if they meet the financial 
criteria, and one for which we are awaiting additional information from the 
applicant.  We are working on the next meeting January 16th (location to be 
determined).   Although the panel wanted to wait for roughly 10 applications 

to come in before they met again, we're moving forward with the five.  The 
plan is, at the next meeting, the panel will review the applications and 
them select a sub-committee to conduct a site visit.  Then, at a subsequent 
meeting, the facility has an opportunity to make a presentation, the 
subcommittee will give a report on the site visit, and the panel will vote 
to recommend to the Governor.  That would be followed by an appointment by 
the Governor's Office.  Unfortunately, it will still take a few months.

Denver, 

Thank you for your response.  We need emergency funds and permits right now. 

A 13 story 97 unit building full of senior citizens will fall into the ocean 
if we think we have time and not to act right now to repair the damage that 
has been caused by the jetties at the port in Cape Canaveral.  We need funds 
now.  We have no money allocated for this tragic situation. 

We need the officials to act promptly and properly.  We have talked with 
engineers that used coquina rock in the past and it has held up the best.  We 

desire to follow their advice of a wall with rock and sand in front with seat 

oats and plants to secure the dune.  We only have 29 feet left and with the 
size of our building we need a larger foundation of land for safety and 
security.  

We cannot wait until 2003 or even a few months - We must act now.  The home 
owners are gathering together and petitions are being put together.  Many of 
the home owners wanted to share their feelings but did not know how or to 
who.  They will be calling.   We have no choice but to seek the highest level 

of action and hold those in the decision making positions accountable. 

 I am one of the youngest owners and I felt compelled to stand up for the 
elderly in this building.  They would have no where to live if the building 
is condemned.  Our insurance does not cover beach erosion and we could stand 
to lose our insurance all together if the government does not secure the 
dunes now.  It is truly a scary situation. 
Channel 13 and the Orlando Sentinel reported on our building today and other 
networks have called.  I pray I can say that the government did the right 
thing.  We need funds and repair today not tomorrow.  Please feel free to 
call me. 

I will be at 321-728-0909 until Tuesday night and back at 407-539-3994 after 
that.  It will be cheaper for the government to act now and not wait until we 

lose the whole dune and then the government has to spend more.  We need to 
learn from the Airport security mistakes and not overpay by waiting to long 
to do something to prevent problems. 

Thank you for your time and consideration in advance.  Blessings! 
Sincerely,

send it to this address. It will come to me. 




Dear Gov. Bush: 

Thank you for taking the time to read this.  Im going to be as brief as possible. 

Consider this a report from the front lines of adoption.  I am in the trenches, working to help women and children every single day of every single week, including but not limited to holidays and weekends.  My day to day activities are not hypothetical, they are the real thing. 

The adoption bill which you allowed to become law last session is an impracticable nightmare.  WOMENARE HAVING ABORTIONS because we cant help them with their adoption plans.  We're too busy printing reams of meaningless paperwork and going to court for unnecessary hearings.  Plus, the fathers have all the rights anyway, so the desire of the birth mother is one step away from irrelevant. 

We, the front-line adoption professionals, are so mired in nonsensical paperwork and meaningless pleadings and filings that we are unable to do our jobs.  Adoption fees have increased significantly due to the extraordinary amount of time it takes to comply with this ridiculous law. 

If I was only working on one adoption at a time, the law would be reasonably straightforward, and, although it includes a bunch of meaningless and extraneous procedures which serve to do nothing but waste our time, it could be followed in some cases.  But Im notonly working on one adoption, Im working on 25-30, and compliance with this law is IMPOSSIBLE. 

This letter is obviously not meant to be a treatise on the ups and downs of this law.  I just want you to know that this law is worse than you can imagine, and that Skip Campbell lied and lied and lied to you and everyone else when he told you that it would streamline adoption.  My office is hiring an extra legal secretary just to keep up with the meaningless pleadings, hearings, orders, and exhibits, and the cost of the new employee will have to be passed on to the adoptive families. 

This bill never should have become law.  Someone needs to repeal it and let us get back to doing our jobs. 

If you want details, let me know and we can sit down together.  Ill go over the life-span of an adoption case with you  not hypothetically, like Skip, but FOR REAL.  Youll see what Im talking aboutI promise! 

Thanks for reading

We can not do any releases or other coverage. I heard from NBC this morning 
and they wanted to pull the donation because we are a state agency and not 
a 501C3 non profit. I have scrambled around to line up some of my community 
501C3's to accept the donation for us. They are afraid that should any 
press coverage result stating we (DCF) had received a donation from them 
they would be swamped with calls from other states and governors. I assured 
them we would handle it through other avenues and I would get back to them. 
As of right now the State foster parents association, Special Opportunity 
Fund of South Florida and the Foster Care Council of Southwest Florida will 
accept the donation. My office will still manage it but officially it is 
theirs. The National Guard called this morning and will assist within 
allowable guidelines. Thanks Governor! 
I will let you all know the final arrangements.

Just a quick note to let you know about actual savings produced when people 
from different agencies work together in technology. The State Technology 
Office combined our Oracle software license purchase last week with those of 
the Agency for Workforce Innovation, Agency for Healthcare Administration, 
Florida Department of Law Enforcement, and the Department of Education. 
Because of the size of the individual purchases, each agency was able to 
negotiate a discount.  However, by combining the purchases, the STO was able 
to negotiate an additional $640,000 in savings this year.  Over the next 
three years, an additional savings of $400,000 in lower maintenance fees 
will also be realized.  The cooperation between these agencies has allowed 
us to save the state significant dollars.  I want to thank Tom McGurk, 
Rhonda Medows, Tim Moore and Commissioner Charlie Crist and their staff for 
helping in the coordination of this effort. I also want to thank Cynthia 
Henderson and DMS purchasing staff for their assistance in coordinating this 
multi-agency project through the purchasing process. 

By working together to aggregate purchases for commonly used technologies 
within the agencies, I am confident this is the first of many statewide cost 
savings ventures to follow!

Governor: 

Finally some success.  We have successfully negotiated the launch of a new 
program between Florida's production and advertising agency community.  It's 
called Production Partners and it is designed to foster greater networking 
and communication between the two divergent groups.  The info below was sent 
out today to all of our local film offices and to the membership of the 
Advertising Federation - Florida Chapter.  A press release will follow in 
the coming days.

Subject: Production Partners Program 


Dear Film Commissioners and 4th District AAF Club Presidents: 

The September 11th terrorist incident has brought all citizens throughout 
the USA closer together to fight a common enemy.  Throughout the country 
though, an unanticipated repercussion of September 11th has been a down turn 
in business activity for many industry sectors.  As a result of this, the 
film & entertainment production industry and the advertising industry have 
experienced a lackluster fourth quarter for new business activity in 2001. 
To address this business downturn, the Governor's Office of Film & 
Entertainment has worked to begin a process of collaboration with the 
advertising industry to reach out to keep Florida business in Florida. This 
new collaboration is geared to help you take control, to help Florida's 
indigenous film & entertainment and advertising industries get better 
acquainted with one another, and to increase awareness to the quality media 
resources that are in your own community.  We want to help you form new 
partnerships of mutual interest and forge new friendships in the name of 
marketing in your own back yard. The Sept. 11th terrorist incident has hurt 
both our industries and this is one way to fight back!  

The Governor's Office of Film & Entertainment* (OF&E) is pleased to begin 
implementing the "Production Partners Program" in conjunction with the 
American Advertising Federation, District 4-Florida** (Ad Fed). We 
look forward to joining our Ad Fed partners and hope this new collaboration 
will be of benefit to both organizations. 

This historic cooperative effort will be started with initial pilot programs 
in fourteen rural/urban areas of the state containing both local film 
commission offices and Ad Fed Clubs. The hope is that both groups will 
increase business activity between each other and learn more about one 
another's resources.  Both the Ad Fed Club member chapters and the Film 
Commission industry organizations have much more in common with one another 
than has been fostered or pursued in the past. 

Please refer to the attached document for your review***, which outlines the 

specifics of the program and how it will be rolled out at the local Film 
Commission offices and Ad Fed Club chapters level.  We look forward to this 
being a positive and beneficial effort for our industries and assisting you 
any way we can.

Dear Governor Bush: 

Congratulations on a job well done Governor!  While the Special Session 
of the Legislature has not yet come to a close, it is apparent to this 
Republican observer it will be a tremendous success for the sunshine 
state, thanks mainly to your leadership and the team work of President 
McKay and Speaker Feeney. 

There is however one issue in the CS/SB 2C Conference Report that was 
hastily crafted in the final hours over the weekend that deserves some 
close scrutiny.  The proviso on line item 570 of Section 6 of the 
General Government budget contains language that automatically cancels 
all contracts between the state and private firms to operate prison 
facilities in Florida. 

While this proviso is intended to save the state money and there is a 
provision that allows for a re-issuing of the RFP's to private 
companies, there is some ambiguous language regarding who would set the 
standards and criteria for the new RFP's.  This ambiguity could (and I 
feel would) lead to a point where there is a "non-response" situation 
for all proposals.  In that case, the proviso then calls for the 
Department of Corrections to step in and take over some, if not all of 
these facilities.  All of this would occur prior to next summer. 

In my opinion, private prison companies have been a terrific asset to 
our state, and so I would ask that you please examine this situation 
closely.  If your conclusions determine the same type of uncertainty in 
this wording, I would urge that you please reject the proviso language 
on line item 570 and request the Legislature to take a second look.  I 
think a full and fair hearing from all sides of the privatization issue 
next session would undoubtedly lead to a better work product for the 
people of Florida. 

Thank you for your consideration and if you need any additional 
information, I would be happy to oblige.  Again, congratulations on a 
great special session and I hope you and your family have a very Merry 
Christmas. 

Sincerely, 


Tom Slade

Dear Mr. Bush, 

   I remember coming to you with a plea for help.  I remember how stern and 
serious you took the meeting.  I remember you assigning someone to take care 
of the matter.  Well, here we are, nothing's changed other than DCF trying 
to cover its ass.  Let me give you a quick idea as to what I've lost during 
this ordeal: my truck, my job, my dignity, and my freedom.  I can't do this 
anymore.  Your agencies have blantently and provably broken the law, 
violated my rights & civil liberties, harbored an abusive individual and 
lied to cover it up in a swamp of paper work, broken promises and mis 
represented statements.  When the inspector general showed up at my house, 
his only concern was finding a fall guy in the matter; Delisa Mathews will 
be the target I'm sure.  When they dealt with Nancy and Al, it was purely a 
"prove DCF didn't relatiate" routine.  Now, when I talk to Sue Grey & 
BaryBeth on the matter, it's "we don't know anything" or "we can't tell you 
anything".  Well, tell me this Jeb, how is it that I've commited NO CRIME, 
I've done EVERYTHING that DCF has told me and I'm STILL paying for this??? 
No more.  I've waited long enough and sacrificed everything I can.  Is this 
the type of organization that runs the state I live in?  Well, it seems that 
my hands were bound 8 years ago when I was raped & they're still bound 
today.  I'm turning Charlie over to DCF as it's clear that I have no help in 
this matter and DCF has a state budget.  Personally, I hope you feel a 
little better knowing that an 8 year child can't be protected in your state 
because you don't have a clue as to what goes on behind your back.  As for 
me, I'll spend the next 5 or so years trying to recover what has taken me a 
lifetime to aquire and as for Charlie, all I can do is hope he makes it. 

Thanks for your help, 
John Greiner 

If you can't/won't help me, at least prevent this from happening to other 
innocent people.

Subject: CONFIDENTIAL: Prospect follow up



Regarding the prospect you called me about this morning: 

After researching the company and recent history in Florida, I called the 
contact the CEO gave you. We had a brief conversation before he had to 
leave, but he will get back to me this evening or tomorrow. I also left a 
message for Stu Turley, to let him know you had followed up and see what 
else he could tell me.  

Here's a stroke of luck that we may, if we get the chance, use at the right 
time:  Manny Fernandez (Gartner, UF Trustee) is on the prospects Board, 
their executive committee, and chairs their "Corporate Governance" 
committee. 

Regarding the permitting issues, I spent considerable time getting briefed 
by their local attorneys, Wade Hopping and Gary Hunter. I asked Gary to 
provide me with a written summary of their issues which will probably be 
more accurate than my retelling of the story.  Hopefully, the client will 
allow this, and you can use it to assess the situation.  This is one side of 
the story, and I am sure DEP has a different perspective. 

The permitting problem that I was aware of when you called me had to do with 
the company not getting air permits before they began an expansion about 2 
years ago. They were under the impression that their existing permits would 
be sufficient.  That situation was corrected.  [FYI: this is a "Title V" air 
emission facility....fiberglass emissions are a bit nasty.] 

More recently they have had problems with manatees and US Fish and Wildlife 
and local manatee clubs.  I am told the company has asked for help from your 
office to get US F & W  to respect Florida rules (speed) within the barge 
canal.  This issue has been very difficult for them, and remains a problem. 

But they are really unhappy about the "raid" you mentioned.  And if their 
lawyers account is reasonably accurate, they have every reason to be. 
Apparently a busload of DEP law enforcement officers, complete with flack 
jackets and guns, with press there to witness, descended upon one of their 
plants in response to a caller who alleged they were dumping hazardous 
waste.  DEP reps apparently mentioned to the press, and they reported, that 
this was a "criminal investigation" involving "suspected felonies".  That 
was in February, '01.  My understanding is that prior to the "raid", when 
the company first heard about the allegations, they did their own testing 
(after informing DEP in case they wanted to witness) and found nothing.  And 
apparently DEP didn't either.  The company feels their reputation was 
needlessly damaged and that the whole thing was mishandled.  

So, we have a lot to overcome to convince the CEO to invest more in Florida.

Dear Gov. Bush, 

I've been meaning to write, but you know how things pile up. 

Anyway, I think your Service First initiative was a good idea. 

And, I think your brother, President Bush, has done a great job in response 
to the September 11 attacks. 

Mrs. Bush, too, has responded well, and it's nice to hear someone, and a 
teacher at that, with a southern accent do so well on national TV.  So 
often, a southern accent is looked down on, and I think she will take care 
of that! 

As a National Board Ceritified Teacher in Leon County, I do hope that all 3 
of you will continue to make education in the elementary grades a priority.  
After all, if the foundations are not built there, they will not be able to 
achieve in high school. 

I know this is too late to do any good, but I just got time to read today's 
paper.  I see that President Bush will be in Orlando tomorrow.  I think it 
would have made a greater impact on the tourism industry if he visited 
Disney World or one of the other theme parks__at least for a few minutes.  I 
have lived in 3 foreign countries and 3 States, and Disney World is what 
everyone thinks of when they think of Florida. 

By the way, if your trip to Spain is rescheduled and you need teachers in 
your entourage, I would be happy to go.  I attended a course in Madrid this 
summer on a scholarship through the Spanish Embassy and DOE and think there 
should be more exchange between the two countries.

My son is Charles Anderson jr who attended gulf beaches school in 1998. I became very active in FAPE and education inclusion. I ended up in litigation with the school system. Mr. bush you were instrumental in his attending a private school which met his needs and changed an extremely depressed and emotionally distract child into a confident successful little man. We spoke about his plight at the family CAFE in 1999 and 2000. His handicap of narcolepsy caused much ridicule and torment among the teachers as well as kids in public school. Now the state is undoing all we and he accomplished. He is rapidly regressing back to the hopelessness and despair he once suffered.  Please stop this abuse. All these lawyers and judges are concerned about is who writes the check. I am willing to leave with him to keep him safe and fear of jail or prison is a small price for me. here is my story

Dear Jeb,  I am concerned about the practice of issuing drivers licenses to 
people with Visas that are about to expire.  Yesterday I was in the Drivers 
License Bureau and observed many people with Visa's that expire this month  
yet still given a Florida License that is good for four years.  About 30 
percent of the people coming into this office were from other countries.  If 

the Visas are expiring within a week or two, why is Florida issuing a 
license

Subject:        Background info on OxyContin legislation package to be announced in Orlando tomorrow

Greg,

Per your request, here are some bullets regarding the process by which this legislation was developed:

(OxyContin is a breakthrough chronic pain management medicine developed by Purdue Pharma, with an explosion in use of product from its intro in 1996 - see attached sales graph in Tab 6 of accompanying Goldenrod handout)

1) The impetus for legislation was: a) a dramatic, sharp spike in overdose deaths reported in state since Summer, 2000; b) OxyContin abuse is a phenomenon largely driven through prescription fraud by addicts and a few bad doctors violating legal and ethical codes by grossly over prescribing these drugs - either deliberately, in a willfully ignorant manner, or in simple ignorance of proper pain management practices; and finally C) the seemingly lethargic ability of the Board of Medicine to shut down these bad doctors.

2)  Office of Drug Control, with SEN Burt providing support for any resultant legislation, initiated an broad effort to turn this problem around.

It has attempted to do this by:

        A) receiving a comprehensive brief from the Board of Medicine's Quality Assurance Committee in the early August on what the disciplinary process is for doctors accused of malfeasance and/or nonfeasance; and getting commitments from the group to be part of the process to make improvements so as to avoid the horror stories this Office has been made aware of, of bad doctor abuses occurring around the state; setting stage for recognition  by the medical community that more must be done to "police its own" in a more effective manner

        B) making OxyContin abuse a priority of the Drug Policy Advisory Council meeting in Tampa on 27 August, with the Council fully supporting a comprehensive fix to long standing problems in how the prescription drug system functions in Florida, and the underlying problems with chronic pain management;  this then reinforced the public hearing process.

        C) Board of Medicine convened a series of open hearings on the problem around the state in late summer and fall to vette the various recommendations pouring forth from the medical and law enforcement communities on fixing this problem.  The Bd. of Medicine has been very proactive in this regard; FDLE, AHCA, and DOH have all also stepped up to the plate to help design an effective piece of legislation.

No doubt, the medical community - to include especially the FMA, Bd. of Pharmacists, and the Nurses Assoc. - and others I can't remember off the top of my head - also all wanted to participate in this process, and did so. In conversation I had with their reps., it was clear they wanted to be intimately involved in this effort, so as to not have overly onerous rules/laws foisted on them  - and they were by being full participants.

I myself represented this Office at the first meeting in Ft. Lauderdale on 29 August, attended by all of the above, plus SEN Burt and AG Butterworth. Ideas were discussed, tabled for review for legal sufficiency, common sense checks.

        BOTTOM LINE:  This legislation pulls no punches, and has been developed with the participation of all of the above groups.  I do not know how many have seen the text, but the three bills incorporate many of the 61 suggestions adopted through the Bd. of Medicine's hearing process.  The substantive bill is the crux, with many ideas put forward - such as tamper proof prescription pads - which have been in effect for many years in other states.  I can think of nothing in the legislation that is "revolutionary" or which is not currently in practice in some other state.

The Electronic database is accompanied by a public records exemption bill to assuage the civil liberties concerns with centralized medical database repositories being maintained by the state.  Finally, Criminal penalties have been strongly pushed by SEN Burt, and are a good response to the horror stories these various public hearings brought to light from law enforcement, concerned health care practitioners, and people who have lost loved ones to Oxy ODs.


Technical questions raised by Governor on bullet four as to which specific violations are meant I'm still waiting for an answer from author of that portion.

Governor Bush.......Chief Lauer and i were on the call and  the issue deals 
with another "general, non-specific" alert based upon the holiday season and 
the historical activity of the Al Queida around this time of the year. 
Governor Ridge was clear that the information was "not specific" to any 
particular State and that, should information become available specific to 
any state or location, he would contact us. 

Governor Ridge will be having a press conference immediately to advise the 
nation of this alert. 

While he said he could not reveal the sources, the "credibility of the 
information rises above the norm". 

He emphasized the fact that America "remains on alert".  The top things Gov 
Ridge recommended was 1) to constantly remind our citizens that we are at 
war, 2) now is not the time to pull back from our efforts accross the 
Country, especially as it relates to critical infrastructure protection. 

Governor Ridge stated that his challenge is now to "develop a language" for 
alerts in the future that would be more meaningful. 

Several questions from Governors around the Country reference the need for 
more specifics when these types of Alerts are issued to avoid losing 
credibility.

Denver,
 
This morning, I contacted Tony McNeal (permitting administrator with Beaches and Coastal Systems).  He had previously spoken with Ms Blake regarding her inquiry into coastal armoring at the Villager Condominiums in Indialantic.  Unfortunately, the Villager Condominium has not yet submitted a permit application to the Department.  While the Governor has declared a coastal emergency, the local governments apparently have not approved emergency armoring for the Villager Condominium due to the distance of the bluff to the condominium (approximately 29 feet).  I spoke with Ms. Blake this morning and advised her the she could still apply with the Department for armoring under the emergency order.  We had a general conversation about the requirements and options available to her (wood retaining wall, rock revetment, etc.).  Also, we chatted about the need to demonstrate vulnerability in order to be eligible for coastal armoring.  She and the residents of the Villager are concerned that they cannot wait until the scheduled 2003 beach restoration project.  She will be putting together a permit application and submitting it to the Department within the near future.  I encouraged her to contact me if she had any questions or ran into any problems.
 
Let me know if you have any questions.
 
Thanks
 
Mike

Dear Mr. Bush, 
Thank you for your response to my email but the concern we have is that with 
29 feet between our building and the cliff edge we well not be able to 
withstand two more seasons of Northeasterly storms and God forbid we have to 
endure a hurricane.  
Also help me understand why it is, that it is so difficult to obtain permits 
for preventive measures rather than waiting for emergency conditions.  Our 
building is 13 stories and for us to wait until the cliff edge is 10 to 15 
ft. from the building before  armoring structures are considered, seems to be 
very foolish.   Everywhere I turn I am told no armoring structures, then I go 
down to Melbourne Beach and they received a permit from the DEP for an 
armoring structure.  But, this permit was not obtained until he was in an 
emergency condition.  Please, any help you can direct me to would be much 
appreciated.  We believe NOW is the time to act.

A Times Editorial 


A shameful retreat on arsenic 
 St. Petersburg Times, 
published December 2, 2001 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

The arrogance and greed that have come to grip the Florida Legislature were 
on full display Tuesday in Tallahassee. There, lawmakers siding with 
big-business lobbyists killed a bill to outlaw arsenic-laced wood from 
Florida's public playgrounds. 

Of course, "We Bring You Arsenic" is not the message of their ad campaign. 
It's just the result. Lawmakers on the House Agriculture Committee should be 
ashamed for putting the $4-billion wood-treatment industry before the health 
of Florida's children. The Florida Chamber of Commerce blew a terrific 
chance. It could have improved the image of Florida business by showing that 
corporations were responsible enough to balance their profits with public 
safety. Instead the chamber threw its weight behind chemical processors and 
the forestry industry. Rep. Larry Crow of Palm Harbor watched the committee 
kill his bill 6-3. 

The bill is dead, but with any justice the fallout won't be far away. 
Florida is on the leading edge of the treated-lumber debate. More 
arsenic-treated wood is sold here than anywhere else. A series of stories by 
the St. Petersburg Times' Julie Hauserman has prodded federal, state and 
local regulators to take a fresh look at the safety of arsenic-treated wood. 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is testing playgrounds across the 
country, Congress wants some answers and two of the largest home-improvement 
chains face class-action lawsuits by consumers who claim the lumber leaked 
harmful chemicals onto their property. Lawmakers will regret their vote if 
claims of safety by the industry are blown apart by the courts, regulators 
or science. 

There's nothing particularly radical about wanting safer alternatives to 
treated wood. What's perverse about Crow's opponents is that they want to 
see harm before doing the right thing.

Subject: Production Partners Program 


Dear Film Commissioners and 4th District AAF Club Presidents: 

The September 11th terrorist incident has brought all citizens throughout 
the USA closer together to fight a common enemy.  Throughout the country 
though, an unanticipated repercussion of September 11th has been a down turn 
in business activity for many industry sectors.  As a result of this, the 
film & entertainment production industry and the advertising industry have 
experienced a lackluster fourth quarter for new business activity in 2001. 
To address this business downturn, the Governor's Office of Film & 
Entertainment has worked to begin a process of collaboration with the 
advertising industry to reach out to keep Florida business in Florida. This 
new collaboration is geared to help you take control, to help Florida's 
indigenous film & entertainment and advertising industries get better 
acquainted with one another, and to increase awareness to the quality media 
resources that are in your own community.  We want to help you form new 
partnerships of mutual interest and forge new friendships in the name of 
marketing in your own back yard. The Sept. 11th terrorist incident has hurt 
both our industries and this is one way to fight back!  

The Governor's Office of Film & Entertainment* (OF&E) is pleased to begin 
implementing the "Production Partners Program" in conjunction with the 
American Advertising Federation, District 4-Florida** (Ad Fed). We 
look forward to joining our Ad Fed partners and hope this new collaboration 
will be of benefit to both organizations. 

This historic cooperative effort will be started with initial pilot programs 
in fourteen rural/urban areas of the state containing both local film 
commission offices and Ad Fed Clubs. The hope is that both groups will 
increase business activity between each other and learn more about one 
another's resources.  Both the Ad Fed Club member chapters and the Film 
Commission industry organizations have much more in common with one another 
than has been fostered or pursued in the past. 

Please refer to the attached document for your review***, which outlines the 

specifics of the program and how it will be rolled out at the local Film 
Commission offices and Ad Fed Club chapters level.  We look forward to this 
being a positive and beneficial effort for our industries and assisting you 
any way we can.

ballot in the near future. Others have indicated to me that this idea has 
actually been floating around Tally for several years. Based on what has 
been provided, this seems to be a good, viable program. 

That said, Micky Arison, myself and other friends who have been approached 
don't want to lend our support unless this is something that you are 
supportive of, or at least "neutral" on. We'd appreciate it if somebody 
could let us know. 

Hope things are going well...hope to see you tomorrow in Orlando. All my 
best.

Dear Governor Bush, 

I was recently at a Restoration of Rights workshop in St. Petersburg and a 
couple of questions arose that I thought would best be answered by you. 

From the discussion, it sounded like applicants who submit their paperwork 
don't hear from the Clemency Board about a number of different items such as 
the following: if their applications have been received; if there is any 
paperwork missing; when their petitions will be heard; or if the 
applications have been refused, why they were refused. 

If this is accurate, as Governor, what is your position on the Clemency 
Board's lack of response to applicants? Are there good reasons for the lack 
of response? Is there something else that applicants need to do to receive 
status updates from the Clemency Board during the process? 

Thanks very much for your consideration. I look forward to your response. 

Happy Thanksgiving. 

Kathy Honan

Just a follow up, they have their annual Talahassee meetings on Feb 25 and 26 this year.  There is alot of turmoil in the Health Insurance marketplace, and lots of discussion needs to take place.  Aside from our own problems, the consumer needs assistance.

I have two agendas.  My insurance business may be in crisis.  The other is to get you re-elected.  Anything positive here, even if just PR, gives us more ammunition in our efforts for helping you. I am hopeful that we can change the bottem line in Broward next time around.  The Dems were surprised at how many of us showed up for the redistricting at BCC.

My best wishes to you and your family for a Happy and Healthy New Year, from myself, and the Weston Republican Club.

Dear Dr. Elias:
 
Thank you for your e-mail to Governor Bush.  We are well aware of the issues you have raised, and consider them to be very important.  Florida's foreign-trained physician assistants, along with all our other physician assistants, are invaluable resources for the well-being of our citizens.  As for your test score, the Department of Health is in the process of evaluating all the scores.  Based on a preliminary review, there appears to have been a higher than normal passage rate.  Therefore, there is a good chance that you passed.  The Department will be releasing the scores in the very near future, so it shouldn't be much longer now.
 
Thanks for writing,
Frank Jimenez
Office of the Governor

Mayor Greco sent us this request.  Scott Kittel in EDU-OPB is working on 

this.  This is verbatum the Mayor's fax to the Governor. 

The City of Tampa in conjuction with Hillsborough Community College 
would 
like to explore thorugh your office, plans by the state of Florida for 
the 
W.T. Edwards Service Center property.  The W.T. Edwards Service center 
property is located adjacent to HCC's Dale Mabry campus to the north and 
just 
west of Raymond James Stadium.  It is my understanding that three of the 
five 
state agencies housed on the 35 acre parcel have either relocated or are 
in 
the process of relocating from the main building, freeing up 
approximately 20 
acres of the total land area and leaving 2 Department of Corrections 
facilities located along Dr. Martin Luther King Boulevard. 

HCC had approached you in the past concerning their interest about use 
of a 
portion or all of this 35 acre parcel to develop an educational and 
amateur 
sports complex on the site.  This use is consistent with 2 earlier 
resolutions passed unanimously in 1994 and 1998 by the Governor and 
Cabinet 
sittin as the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund, 
offering the 35 acre parcel to the Tampa Sports Authority.  These 
resolutions 
indicated that each of the 5 state agencies needed to commence 
relocation 
plans to make the property available for the future development of an 
amateur 
sports facility. 

HCC has incorporated your earlier direction to pursue public/private 
initiatives for this project.  Together with Dr. Gwendolyn W. 
Stephernson, 
President of HCC, we have discussed several opportunities for 
incorporating 
this directive with our vision of an educational/amateur sports complex. 

Both HCC and the City of Tampa, recognize the overall benefit to our 
community, particularly to the area youth for development of an 
educational 
and amateur sports-related endeavor on this site, which will also have 
an 
overall positive impact on the citizenry of the state of Florida.

Governor, 

NAS Key West informed me today that the transfer of some land from NAS Key 
West to the city will not happen next month as planned.  The US Atlantic 
Fleet has re-evaluated the need for the land and will keep it indefinately. 
I called Admiral Natter, Commander of the Atlantic Fleet, who noted that the 
Secretary of the Navy feels the need to keep the land in Navy control (in 
aftermath of 9/11)--to accommodate increased ships naval ship docking and 
other defense activity.   I would think increased activity will be good for 
local economy (with tourism on the decline).  Navy has agreed to allow for 
dual use of facilities with city as before. 

There may be some local grumbling at first on the holding of land (some 
would like the base gone completely so that they could utilize housing and 
airport for residents/tourism).  I am working with the base and local 
chamber to put together something that shows the current economic impact of 
the military to the community (and if they were to pull out altogether, what 
that would mean economically). 

I called Rep Sorensen and discussed and have also placed calls to the Mayor 
and Chamber president of Key West to make sure that there is minimal 
problems.

               STATEMENT BY HOMELAND SECURITY DIRECTOR TOM RIDGE 


                        The James S. Brady Briefing Room 



4:55 P.M. EST 


     GOVERNOR RIDGE:  I've just completed a conference call with the nation's 
governors to let them know what I'm here to share with the American people.  I 
might add, I also wanted to commend them for their work in improving and 
strengthening homeland security since September 11th.  We've been in frequent 
communication either with the organizations or with individual governors, and I 
think their work to date has reflected the kind of relationship between the 
federal and the state and local government that we need to make a permanent part 
of our homeland security defense. 

     Over the last several days our intelligence in law enforcement agencies 
have seen an increased volume in level of activity involving threats of 
terrorist attacks.  The information we have does not point to any specific 
target either in America or abroad.  And it does not outline any specific type 
of attack. 

     However, the analysts who review this information believe the quantity and 
level of threats are above the norm and have reached a threshold where we should 
once again place the public on general alert, just as we have done on two 
previous occasions since September 11th. 

     During his address on homeland security in Atlanta, President Bush promised 
the American people that when we have evidence of credible threats we will issue 
appropriate alerts.  That is exactly what we're doing here today. 

     The President also reminded all of us that a terrorism alert is not a 
signal to stop your life.  It is a call to be vigilant, to know that your 
government is on high alert and to add your eyes and your ears to our efforts to 
find and stop those who want to do us harm. 

     Our government is taking precautions.  This afternoon, the FBI is issuing a 
terrorist threat advisory update to 18,000 law enforcement agencies across the 
country through the National Law Enforcement Telecommunication System known as 
NLETS.  Law enforcement agencies have been instructed to stay on the highest 
alert and to immediately notify the FBI of any unusual or suspicious activity. 

     Again, I emphasize this perhaps to my own peril, but, again, the threats we 
are picking up are very generic.  They warn of more attacks, but are not 
specific about where or what type.  We do know that the next several weeks, 
which bring the final weeks of Ramadan and important religious observations in 
other faiths, have been times when terrorists have planned attacks in the past. 

     One example is December of 1999.  Authorities in Jordan, Canada and the 
United States uncovered and prevented plans for a series of attacks related to 
the dawn of the new millennium.  Those plans were thwarted when intelligence 
learned about them, and law enforcement arrested the suspected terrorists. 

     Now, obviously, the further removed we get from September 11th, I think the 
natural tendency is to let down our guard.  Unfortunately, we cannot do that. 
We are a nation at war.  We are the targets of enemies who have demonstrated 
they have no remorse about killing thousands of innocent civilians.  The 
government will continue to do everything we can to find and stop those who seek 
to harm us.  And I believe we owe it to the American people to remind them that 
they must be vigilant, as well. 

     I also know the very first question the American people will ask, so 
Governor Ridge, besides being vigilant, what else should my family and I do? 
The answer is you should report any suspicious activity or behavior to local 
authorities.  And perhaps as importantly, you should heed the words of your 
President, who has called on all of us to rely on our good judgment and our 
common sense to continue to live in a spirit of courage and optimism and 
resolve, to defeat the enemy. 

     Q    What makes these threats credible, besides the volume?  And are they 
coming from any specific terrorist group or cell, for example, al Qaeda? 

     GOVERNOR RIDGE:  Every single day the intelligence community gathers 
information and makes judgments -- renders judgments about their credibility and 
their relevance.  And the accumulation of information we've received over the 
past 
couple of days has risen to the level where we thought it was appropriate to 
again put out a general alert. 

     It comes from multiple sources, and obviously there are men and women 
within the community whose business it has been for years to take a look at that 
information and draw conclusions and determine what we should do about it.  But 
it is just the volume, as well as, obviously, the credibility associated with 
some of the information we've received that led us to have this discussion 
around which there was no disagreement -- that it was at the volume and at the 
level we should remind America we're still at war, we're still at risk, be 
vigilant, be aware. 

     Q    Is there any connection between this new warning and the Israeli 
attacks and the Israeli response to the Palestinian suicide bombings? 

     GOVERNOR RIDGE:  There is nothing in the information that we received that 
would draw a specific connection.  But it is important, I think, to note that 
from time to time, and even in a very vigilant society that's had to deal with 
acts of political terrorism, not for months, but for decades, that the 
unthinkable can happen and innocent people can be killed. 

     Q    Governor Ridge, do you feel that there has been, as you said, law 
enforcement agencies letting down their guard, and the public letting down their 
guard, since Ashcroft announced that there was a heightened state of alert a 
couple weeks ago?  Do you feel that the American public has kind of moved in a 
sense of comfort since that heightened state of alert and nothing has happened? 

     GOVERNOR RIDGE:  Well, I think that America generally has remained at a 
state of readiness and alert and, fortunately, has basically accepted the 
President's encouragement to go live your lives -- at least the retail sales on 
the day after Thanksgiving suggested that a lot of people were back into a 
routine normally associated with this time of the year. 

     But I think it is very predictable and very understandable and very human, 
the further you get, the further away you are from an event, that distance and 
time may even unconsciously erode your commitment, erode that wariness, that 
attention span.  And so, again, to remind everyone we're still at war, we're 
still at risk.  The one war/two battlefields, you know, you've seen pictures of 
those Marines and those soldiers digging in, they don't have to be reminded 
because they've got a conventional battlefield.  Ours is still an unconventional 
battlefield and I think it's very appropriate that we remind all Americans to be 
at alert. 

     Q    Governor Ridge, to follow up, the last time you were here in the 
briefing room you told us that we were on a state of alert indefinitely.  Did 
you ever specifically ask local or federal officials to back off of that state 
of alert?  Or have they backed off in any way? 

     GOVERNOR RIDGE:  I would suspect, depending on the state and depending on 
the decisions that some of the governors may have made in terms of the resources 
and the people they've committed to defending what they consider to be points of 
vulnerability in their states, they may have made some adjustments.  And, 
basically, in my conversation with my colleagues a few minutes ago, I said now 
is not the time to back off.  I believe you're out there, I believe you're 
vigilant, but over the next several weeks, based on this information, it's my 
recommendation you remain at the state of readiness. 

     And the other recommendation, frankly, was to remind their citizens, no 
matter where you live, it can be a big state with a dense population, or you can 
be a smaller state with a lot of rural communities.  We have no way of assuring 
or guaranteeing or pinpointing where the terrorists will attack. 

     Q    Can I ask you about the anthrax?  Are you guys now satisfied that 
Ottilie Lundgren's case came from cross-contamination?  And is that, frankly, 
more of a reason for people to worry about the mail than less? 

     GOVERNOR RIDGE:  Based upon the identification of the letter that followed 
the Daschle letter, and its delivery to the home in her neighborhood, it 
certainly offers a plausible explanation for what transpired.  But it's also, at 
least to date, in conflict with the fact that they'd taken swabs in her house 
where the mail may have been deposited, and other places, and there are no 
traces in her home.  So I think it adds some credibility to an explanation, but 
it does not confirm that explanation. 

     Q    Governor, can you help us and the American people understand the scope 
of this new information?  Does this increased level picked up by intelligence 
services emanate from one part of the world, or is it communications with 
terrorist cells around the world?  And do any of the communications -- is the 
source of those communications here in the United States? 

     GOVERNOR RIDGE:  The information we receive is literally from, as you 
report and as you know, from all around the world.  The sources, in terms of 
their geography, are no different than anything that we received in the past. 
But -- I mean the origin.  But the sources are more credible, and we might just 
say the decibel level is higher, as they talk about potential attacks. 

     Again, the origin is pretty much the same in terms of the location of where 
the information may have been gathered.  But the -- those people involved in the 
communication we deemed as more credible.  And it's also the volume over the 
past couple of days. 

     Q    If I could follow up on that, if I may.  As you evaluate when to come 
before the American people and issue the kind of alert you're issuing here, is 
it a function more of quantity of intelligence, or quality?  Can you give a -- 
if you have any kind of a framework that you can share with us, we'd certainly 
love to know about that. 

     GOVERNOR RIDGE:  Well, it's a very appropriate question.  Suffice it to say 
that judgments are placed upon the different kinds of communication, the 
different kinds of information received on a day-to-day basis.  And, obviously, 
within the intelligence community we've got a lot of very talented people with a 
great deal of experience and are very intuitive.  A lot of them are very 
intuitive about the kind of information they've received, and their ability to 
connect the dots is based upon experience, as well. 

     And sometimes there's legitimate disagreement within the community as to 
whether or not they're specific enough or credible enough, or rise to a level 
where you've got to bring this matter before the American public.  And, 
unfortunately -- giving you a general answer to a specific question, it's more 
of an art than a science -- but the conclusion of everyone who has looked at 
this information over the past couple days was, again, a time to remind America 
we're at war, we're fighting them in Afghanistan, we've got to fight them in 
America, and one of the best ways to combat your enemy is to be alert and be 
mindful -- be situationally aware. 

     Q    Is this information specifically connected, did you say, to the 
observations of Ramadan or other holidays?  And did you consider the impact on 
holiday retail sales of making this warning, and how did that discussion go? 

     GOVERNOR RIDGE:  Certainly, the convergence of different religious 
observations over the next couple of weeks is -- and the impact that that has on 
the celebration of faith and holidays is something that we certainly took into 
consideration. 

     But you know, terrorists, even if there was a specific timetable or a 
specific holiday toward which they were pointing -- I mean, I think we know, 
based on previous experience, that if we were able to disrupt that activity, and 
if they had to postpone it, they would wait until they were prepared and could 
strike. 

     So, yes, it was considered.  We don't believe there should be, nor there 
will be, any change in anybody's plans to participate in their religious 
holidays and to enjoy the seasons and their families.  But, again, the 
convergence of information suggests, ladies and gentlemen of America:  We're at 
war.  Be on alert. 

     Q    Governor Ridge, how should the public understand the process, this 
alert process?  You come out and give us alerts from time to time, and tell 
people what you're told them today.  But alerts never seem to get lifted; we 
just get new ones to replace the old ones.  And I'm just wondering if you worry 
about people becoming jaded as a result of this process. 

     Q    What's the President's role in -- 

     GOVERNOR RIDGE:  The President -- this matter was presented to the 
President this morning, and he approved our decision to go forward and make the 
announcement.  Discerning specific, credible information and concluding that it 
gives rise to a reminder to America that we're still at war, is a -- as I said 
before, is an art, it's not a science.  And it would be so much easier, 
admittedly, if there were more specifics we could refer to.  But there are not. 

     These are shadow soldiers.  This is a shadow enemy.  As a soldier, from 
time to time, in my personal experience and a lot of other soldiers have 
experienced in a more conventional wartime situation, offer -- often, you are 
given information about the location of the enemy, the size of the enemy, 
perhaps how the enemy is equipped.  This is a little bit different time. 

     But, again, as we make those calculations and draw those conclusions, 
there's not always broad-based agreement that this is a credible threat.  We 
viewed these as credible, and that's why we're just asking America to be on 
alert, be ready. 

     Q    Is this more serious than the other two threats, though?  Is this 
alert -- threat alert more serious than the previous two? 

     GOVERNOR RIDGE:  You know, conceivably, if you take a look, this has been 
the third alert, clearly.  But every day, we accumulate information.  Every day, 
the analysts take a look at the sources.  Every day, they try to put the dots 
together.  But it's not every day that either Attorney General Ashcroft or I 
have come out to the podium.  And it has been the aggregation of this 
information and the unanimous conclusion by the experts over the past couple of 
days as they've looked at it, it's now time to come back out and tell -- remind 
America we're still at war and be on alert. 

     Thank you very much. 

                            END                  5:11 P.M. EST

Subject:	CONFIDENTIAL:  Prospect follow up

Regarding the prospect you called me about this morning: 

After researching the company and recent history in Florida, I called the 
contact the CEO gave you. We had a brief conversation before he had to 
leave, but he will get back to me this evening or tomorrow. I also left a 
message for Stu Turley, to let him know you had followed up and see what 
else he could tell me.  

Here's a stroke of luck that we may, if we get the chance, use at the right 
time:  Manny Fernandez (Gartner, UF Trustee) is on the prospects Board, 
their executive committee, and chairs their "Corporate Governance" 
committee. 

Regarding the permitting issues, I spent considerable time getting briefed 
by their local attorneys, Wade Hopping and Gary Hunter. I asked Gary to 
provide me with a written summary of their issues which will probably be 
more accurate than my retelling of the story.  Hopefully, the client will 
allow this, and you can use it to assess the situation.  This is one side of 
the story, and I am sure DEP has a different perspective. 

The permitting problem that I was aware of when you called me had to do with 
the company not getting air permits before they began an expansion about 2 
years ago. They were under the impression that their existing permits would 
be sufficient.  That situation was corrected.  [FYI: this is a "Title V" air 
emission facility....fiberglass emissions are a bit nasty.] 

More recently they have had problems with manatees and US Fish and Wildlife 
and local manatee clubs.  I am told the company has asked for help from your 
office to get US F & W  to respect Florida rules (speed) within the barge 
canal.  This issue has been very difficult for them, and remains a problem. 

But they are really unhappy about the "raid" you mentioned.  And if their 
lawyers account is reasonably accurate, they have every reason to be. 
Apparently a busload of DEP law enforcement officers, complete with flack 
jackets and guns, with press there to witness, descended upon one of their 
plants in response to a caller who alleged they were dumping hazardous 
waste.  DEP reps apparently mentioned to the press, and they reported, that 
this was a "criminal investigation" involving "suspected felonies".  That 
was in February, '01.  My understanding is that prior to the "raid", when 
the company first heard about the allegations, they did their own testing 
(after informing DEP in case they wanted to witness) and found nothing.  And 
apparently DEP didn't either.  The company feels their reputation was 
needlessly damaged and that the whole thing was mishandled.  

So, we have a lot to overcome to convince the CEO to invest more in Florida.

Greetings Most Honorable Governor Jeb Bush, 
Thank You ever so much for your immediate response on October 29 to my 
E-mail to you of same date. In addition Pamella J. Dana, Director 
Office of Tourism, Trade, and Economic Development responded on the first 
of November. Then on November 6, Betty Schmidt of ENTERPRISE FLORIDA, 
Inc. responded to the e-mail and forwarded through the post a copy of 
"Florida Trend's Florida Small Business" The 2001-2002 Guide to Starting 
& Growing a Small Business, which I have found very helpful. 
The best way to contact me is through the US Postal Service, since I have 
had no phone service as of April this year due to being unemployed on the 
fourth of February when the company I was driving for closed its doors. 
My computer is on loan to my son who is recuperating from an accident, as 
he has a phone line.  I travel twenty-three miles to his house about once 
a week to check my e-mail and use the Internet. 
I contacted Vocation Rehabilation Services around the middle of August 
when I found out about the program. On August 29, I was given an 
appointment for September 14 with Carolyn Wilkerson, which was changed to 
September 18.  After making several phone calls to the Cross City office 
I received an appointment and was evaluated on November 21 by Sherry 
Inman. I am currently awaiting the results of this evaluation, which I 
was assured that it would be this week.  Ms. Inman mentioned something 
about the possibility of employment testing water at various locations. 
I have been unable to find a listing on the Internet for anything like 
this. There has been no listings of jobs for which I am qualified or able 
to preform within a fifty mile radius of Cross City. 
I have been continually turned down by local business because of my 
service connected disabilities. Yet the VA only pays me about $98 a 
month.  I have been refused assistance by ever program I have been able 
to find out about. 
My wife Diane was hurt on the job at Great Bear Industries in Cross City 
which limited the jobs she can preform.  On top of that she was struck by 
a car as a pedestrian which compounded her disabilities. Neither 
insurance has fully taken care of her medical bills. Thank God Suwanee 
River Economic Council has put her on call as a care giver which allows 
her to earn $40 for each day they call on her. 
Now I need a job as soon as possible as we are about to lose our home and 
car.  We have no heat as we can not afford to purchase the minimum amount 
of LP gas, but at least Florida Power and the local water department is 
working with us. We need any kind of help or assistance we can get.  We 
are both willing to work but the system refuses to employee us.  Messages 
can be left for us at Diane's mother's number(352)498-2168.  Thanking You 
in advance for any and all assistance you may provide. With All Due 
Respect, Joseph Blitch, PO Box 248, Cross City, FL 32628.

we don't usually place messages of this sort on the site.  Don't think we

Subject:	STO Aggregated Oracle Purchase Results

Just a quick note to let you know about actual savings produced when people 
from different agencies work together in technology. The State Technology 
Office combined our Oracle software license purchase last week with those of 
the Agency for Workforce Innovation, Agency for Healthcare Administration, 
Florida Department of Law Enforcement, and the Department of Education. 
Because of the size of the individual purchases, each agency was able to 
negotiate a discount.  However, by combining the purchases, the STO was able 
to negotiate an additional $640,000 in savings this year.  Over the next 
three years, an additional savings of $400,000 in lower maintenance fees 
will also be realized.  The cooperation between these agencies has allowed 
us to save the state significant dollars.  I want to thank Tom McGurk, 
Rhonda Medows, Tim Moore and Commissioner Charlie Crist and their staff for 
helping in the coordination of this effort. I also want to thank Cynthia 
Henderson and DMS purchasing staff for their assistance in coordinating this 
multi-agency project through the purchasing process. 

By working together to aggregate purchases for commonly used technologies 
within the agencies, I am confident this is the first of many statewide cost 
savings ventures to follow!

Dear Jeb,  I am concerned about the practice of issuing drivers licenses to 
people with Visas that are about to expire.  Yesterday I was in the Drivers 
License Bureau and observed many people with Visa's that expire this month  
yet still given a Florida License that is good for four years.  About 30 
percent of the people coming into this office were from other countries.  If 

the Visas are expiring within a week or two, why is Florida issuing a

Subject:        Background info on OxyContin legislation package to be announced in Orlando tomorrow

Greg,

Per your request, here are some bullets regarding the process by which this legislation was developed:

(OxyContin is a breakthrough chronic pain management medicine developed by Purdue Pharma, with an explosion in use of product from its intro in 1996 - see attached sales graph in Tab 6 of accompanying Goldenrod handout)

1) The impetus for legislation was: a) a dramatic, sharp spike in overdose deaths reported in state since Summer, 2000; b) OxyContin abuse is a phenomenon largely driven through prescription fraud by addicts and a few bad doctors violating legal and ethical codes by grossly over prescribing these drugs - either deliberately, in a willfully ignorant manner, or in simple ignorance of proper pain management practices; and finally C) the seemingly lethargic ability of the Board of Medicine to shut down these bad doctors.

2)  Office of Drug Control, with SEN Burt providing support for any resultant legislation, initiated an broad effort to turn this problem around.

It has attempted to do this by:

        A) receiving a comprehensive brief from the Board of Medicine's Quality Assurance Committee in the early August on what the disciplinary process is for doctors accused of malfeasance and/or nonfeasance; and getting commitments from the group to be part of the process to make improvements so as to avoid the horror stories this Office has been made aware of, of bad doctor abuses occurring around the state; setting stage for recognition  by the medical community that more must be done to "police its own" in a more effective manner

        B) making OxyContin abuse a priority of the Drug Policy Advisory Council meeting in Tampa on 27 August, with the Council fully supporting a comprehensive fix to long standing problems in how the prescription drug system functions in Florida, and the underlying problems with chronic pain management;  this then reinforced the public hearing process.

        C) Board of Medicine convened a series of open hearings on the problem around the state in late summer and fall to vette the various recommendations pouring forth from the medical and law enforcement communities on fixing this problem.  The Bd. of Medicine has been very proactive in this regard; FDLE, AHCA, and DOH have all also stepped up to the plate to help design an effective piece of legislation.

No doubt, the medical community - to include especially the FMA, Bd. of Pharmacists, and the Nurses Assoc. - and others I can't remember off the top of my head - also all wanted to participate in this process, and did so. In conversation I had with their reps., it was clear they wanted to be intimately involved in this effort, so as to not have overly onerous rules/laws foisted on them  - and they were by being full participants.

I myself represented this Office at the first meeting in Ft. Lauderdale on 29 August, attended by all of the above, plus SEN Burt and AG Butterworth. Ideas were discussed, tabled for review for legal sufficiency, common sense checks.

        BOTTOM LINE:  This legislation pulls no punches, and has been developed with the participation of all of the above groups.  I do not know how many have seen the text, but the three bills incorporate many of the 61 suggestions adopted through the Bd. of Medicine's hearing process.  The substantive bill is the crux, with many ideas put forward - such as tamper proof prescription pads - which have been in effect for many years in other states.  I can think of nothing in the legislation that is "revolutionary" or which is not currently in practice in some other state.

The Electronic database is accompanied by a public records exemption bill to assuage the civil liberties concerns with centralized medical database repositories being maintained by the state.  Finally, Criminal penalties have been strongly pushed by SEN Burt, and are a good response to the horror stories these various public hearings brought to light from law enforcement, concerned health care practitioners, and people who have lost loved ones to Oxy ODs.


Technical questions raised by Governor on bullet four as to which specific violations are meant I'm still waiting for an answer from author of that portion.

Dear Governor Bush:

Congratulations on a job well done Governor!  While the Special Session of the Legislature has not yet come to a close, it is apparent to this Republican observer it will be a tremendous success for the sunshine state, thanks mainly to your leadership and the team work of President McKay and Speaker Feeney.

There is however one issue in the CS/SB 2C Conference Report that was hastily crafted in the final hours over the weekend that deserves some close scrutiny.  The proviso on line item 570 of Section 6 of the General Government budget contains language that automatically cancels all contracts between the state and private firms to operate prison facilities in Florida.

While this proviso is intended to save the state money and there is a provision that allows for a re-issuing of the RFPs to private companies, there is some ambiguous language regarding who would set the standards and criteria for the new RFPs.  This ambiguity could (and I feel would) lead to a point where there is a non-response situation for all proposals.  In that case, the proviso then calls for the Department of Corrections to step in and take over some, if not all of these facilities.  All of this would occur prior to next summer.

In my opinion, private prison companies have been a terrific asset to our state, and so I would ask that you please examine this situation closely.  If your conclusions determine the same type of uncertainty in this wording, I would urge that you please reject the proviso language on line item 570 and request the Legislature to take a second look.  I think a full and fair hearing from all sides of the privatization issue next session would undoubtedly lead to a better work product for the people of Florida.

Thank you for your consideration and if you need any additional information, I would be happy to oblige.  Again, congratulations on a great special session and I hope you and your family have a very Merry Christmas.

Sincerely,


Tom Slade

Dear Ms. Ciemniecki: 

Governor Bush has requested that I respond to your letter and email dated 
November 26, 2001.  We appreciate your concern on how this project may 
affect your community. 

In 1999 Manatee County requested the Florida Department of Transportation 
(FDOT) to perform a Project Development and Environment (PD&E) Study on the 
Upper Manatee River Road/Fort Hamer Road corridor upon the completion of a 
feasibility study performed by Manatee County in 1998. The Upper Manatee 
River PD&E Study established a project study area bound by I-75, SR 64, Rye 
Road, CR 675 and US 301.  Within this study area four (4) alternatives, 
I-75, Rye Road + CR 675, and Rye Road + Golf Course Road and the Upper 
Manatee River Road/Fort Hamer Road corridor were examined.  Each of these 
alternatives were examined and compared based on environmental impacts, 
social impacts, construction costs, and local and regional traffic 
efficiency. 

During the traffic analysis phase of the project the following scenarios 
were used: 

                  I-75:  Eight and ten lane alternatives 
               Upper Manatee River Road/Fort Hamer Road:  Four and 
               six lane improvements and a two, four and six 
          lane bridge. 
                  Rye Road + CR 675:  Four lanes 
                  Rye Road + Golf Course Road:  Four lanes 

Based on the level of development (currently under construction and 
approved for construction) within the study area, population estimates 
provided by Manatee County and the 2000 US Census, it was determined that 
the Upper Manatee River Road/Fort Hamer Road corridor was the most 
appropriate corridor to benefit both local and regional traffic needs. 
Since 1979 a total of 19 residential and commercial developments have been 
approved within the study area.  These 19 developments represent, at total 
approved build-out, over 10,000 single family homes and 1,500 multi-family 
units(apartments). 

The recommended lane configuration for the 2025 design year was identified 
as six lanes from SR 64 north to Old Tampa Road, with and six lane bridge 
crossing, and four lanes from Old Tampa Road north to US 301.  This lane 
configuration is consistent with the need identified in the 
Sarasota/Manatee MPO 2025 Financially Feasible Long Range Transportation 
Plan. 

According to the Sarasota/Manatee MPO 2025 Financially Feasible Long Range 
Transportation Plan a total of 26 lanes are needed for all of Manatee 
County by 2025.  Six of these lanes are identified east of I-75 at Upper 
Manatee River Road/Fort Hamer Road.  Currently there are only 12 lanes 
crossing the river and only an additional 10 lanes are affordable 
county-wide. 

The current construction cost estimate (exclusive of right-of-way cost) is 
$44.2 million for the Upper Manatee River Road/Fort Hamer Road corridor 
with six lanes from SR 64 north to Old Tampa Road, inclusive of a six-lane 
bridge crossing, and four lanes from Old Tampa Road north to US 301.  By 
comparison expansion of I-75 to 10 lanes would cost $98.3 million, a four 
lane improvement to Rye Road and CR 675 would cost $90.7 million and a four 
lane improvement to Rye Road and Golf Course Road would cost $126.3 
million. 

Improvements to SR 64 and SR 70 are also part of the transportation 
solution for the east/west movements and do not address the localized and 
regional needs for north and south movements within this portion of Manatee 
County. 

The recommended six and four lane typical sections for Upper 
Manatee River Road/Fort Hamer Road also include sidewalks and designated 
bicycle lanes on both sides of the road for pedestrians. 

The exact location of the proposed bridge crossing was based on several 
factors including available right-of-way, location and orientation of the 
existing river channel and environmental criteria.  Based on emergent 
wetland and floodplain impacts, the Upper Manatee River Road/Fort Hamer 
Road crossing is least impactive of all potential crossings of the four 
corridors analyzed.  The FDOT has received letters from the United State 
Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service 
(NMFS) stating that the project has no significant impact to the natural 
environment or the habitat of any listed threatened or endangered species. 

Noise issues are a concern to the FDOT and a complete noise impact study is 
being performed as part of the study.  Representatives from the FDOT will 
be available to discuss the results of the analysis at the Public Hearing 
in the Spring of 2002. 

On April 13, 2001 the Bradenton Herald ran an article that the Manatee 
Historical Society had determined that the Fort Hamer site was somewhere on 
the recently completed Waterlefe golf course.  The Upper Manatee River PD&E 
has received a letter of "no effect" from the State of Florida's State 
Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO).  This letter was based on the 
research done as part of this PD&E study and based on the research 
performed in conjunction with many of the 19 developments mentioned above. 

I hope this addresses some of the concerns voiced by you and your 
neighbors.  Thank you for your involvement in this project and I would 
encourage you to attend the Public Hearing in the spring of 2002.

Governor Bush.......Chief Lauer and i were on the call and  the issue deals 
with another "general, non-specific" alert based upon the holiday season and 
the historical activity of the Al Queida around this time of the year. 
Governor Ridge was clear that the information was "not specific" to any 
particular State and that, should information become available specific to 
any state or location, he would contact us. 

Governor Ridge will be having a press conference immediately to advise the 
nation of this alert. 

While he said he could not reveal the sources, the "credibility of the 
information rises above the norm". 

He emphasized the fact that America "remains on alert".  The top things Gov 
Ridge recommended was 1) to constantly remind our citizens that we are at 
war, 2) now is not the time to pull back from our efforts accross the 
Country, especially as it relates to critical infrastructure protection. 

Governor Ridge stated that his challenge is now to "develop a language" for 
alerts in the future that would be more meaningful. 

Several questions from Governors around the Country reference the need for 
more specifics when these types of Alerts are issued to avoid losing 
credibility. 

Thanks.....tim

DEAR GOV. JEB, 
I WANTED TO SEND SOME SUGGESTIONS REGARDING THE ECONOMIC STIMULUS HERE IN 
FLORIDA THAT 
MAY BE SOMEWHAT HELPFUL. AS MANY FOREIGNERS ARE A LITTLE NERVOUS OVER 
FLYING  AT THE 
MOMENT TO FLORIDA, ONE STIMULUS FOR LOCAL AND FLORIDA RESIDENTS WOULD BE 
FOR THE 
ATTRACTIONS SUCH AS DISNEY AND UNIVERSAL TO LOWER THEIR ENTRANCE FEES WHICH 
I'M SURE 
WOULD ENHANCE THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS. ALSO, THE EXTREMELY LOW INTEREST 
RATE THAT 
GREENSPAN HAS IMPOSED ON OUR BANKING INSTUTIONS HAS CURTAILED THE 
FLEXIBILITY OF 
MANY OF WE SENIOR RETIREES TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE MANY CHARITABLE, POLITICAL 
AND OTHER 
ORGANIZATIONS, LET ALONE TRAVEL, SHOPPING ETC. THESE ARE CONCERNS FOR MANY 
OF US 
JUST NOW. ALWAYS BEST WISHES TO YOU AND YOUR BROTHER, THE PRESIDENT. 
SINCERELY, MARY CAMPBELL

Dear Dr. Elias:
 
Thank you for your e-mail to Governor Bush.  We are well aware of the issues you have raised, and consider them to be very important.  Florida's foreign-trained physician assistants, along with all our other physician assistants, are invaluable resources for the well-being of our citizens.  As for your test score, the Department of Health is in the process of evaluating all the scores.  Based on a preliminary review, there appears to have been a higher than normal passage rate.  Therefore, there is a good chance that you passed.  The Department will be releasing the scores in the very near future, so it shouldn't be much longer now.
 
Thanks for writing,
Frank Jimenez
Office of the Governor

Subject:	Need for veto of Line Items 570 and 189B

Dear Governor Bush: 

During the conference committee process this past weekend, amendments were 
made in the areas of privatized corrections and the Sexually Violent 
Predator (SVP) project/program which we urgently ask you to veto. 

1)  Section 6 - General Government, Line Item 570: Special Categories 
(Correctional Privatization Commission) directs the Correctional 
Privatization Commission to re-bid by mid-March 2002 all existing private 
prison contracts, thus canceling even those contracts that are in the middle 
of their contract terms. 
*       The language requires that the new bids achieve a 7% cost savings that 
will be determined soley by OPPAGA in consultation with the Dep't of 
Corrections and the Auditor General. 
*       This process is completely disruptive and unfair to all existing private 
contractors who won their current contracts, and is unnecessary. 
*       Under current law, OPPAGA conducts an audit to verify that private 
contractors achieve a 7% savings with the opportunity for the CPC to comment 
on the report and make any necessary adjustments. 
*       To our knowledge, all private prison contracts are achieving the 
statutorily required 7% cost savings at this time. 
*       If the 7% savings are not achieved, the current contracts allow for 
appropriate reductions under the threat of contract termination. 
*       Thus, there is absolutely no need for any further legislative directives 
to the CPC on this issue. 
* 
*       The cancelation of major privatization contracts in mid-term that were 
competitively bid and awarded sends a terrible message to the business 
community as to the state of Florida honoring its contractual commitments. 
Governor, we urge you to veto Line Item 570 and the accompanying language of 
the Conference Report. 
* 
*       2)  Implementing Act, 4C, Section 5, contains language that is tied to 
Line Item 189B and does the following: 
*       Cancels the existing procurement for the development and operation of a 
600-bed Sexually Violent Predator facility which we were awarded by the CPC 
in a competitive bid and after having spent a half million dollars; 
*       Instead, directs DCF to issue a new RFP on just the operation of the 
existing SVP facility; and 
*       Directs the DOC to develop a plan to construct a new major institution 
adjacent to the Desoto Correctional Institution. 

This language constitutes another cancelation of a major privatization RFP 
after an initial award by the CPC and defense of the award through an 
administrative appeal process at great expense to our company and the state 
of Florida.  This sends another terrible signal to the business community as 
to the state of Florida's commitment to privatization.  Our company is fully 
capable of providing for the professional development and operation of an 
SVP facility as set forth in our accepted RFP proposal. We are still 
awaiting an opportunity to begin the negotiations to reach a mutually 
agreeable cost-effective SVP program for the state of Florida.  Governor, we 
urge you to veto Line Item 189B and the accompanying language of the 
Implementing Act.

Subject:	RE: DOE General Counsel 

Dear Mrs. Knox: 

Commissioner Crist is fully committed to the safety and security of our 
school children, and this commitment is reflected, in part, by his careful 
oversight of a highly skilled and dedicated professional practices section 
within the Department responsible for prosecuting misfeasance and 
malfeasance by teachers throughout the State of Florida.  My office is 
responsible for assisting the Commissioner and staff in this crucial effort. 
Yes, we are public servants, and, as such, we work for you and all other 
residents of this fine state. 

We take this responsibility seriously.  Thus, I was troubled to hear of your 
concern over your treatment by members of my staff.  As public servants, we 
cannot let our frustrations get the better of us.  Mrs. Roberts' comment, 
which she did not intend you to hear, was, in fact, directed at you as you 
suspected.  She no doubt tried to cover herself out of embarrassment when 
she realized you were not on hold.  She apologizes for her statement, and I 
ask that you overlook it as uncharacteristic of a public servant with over 
32-years experience in the Office of General Counsel.  By way of 
explanation, if not excuse, I know that she was very nervous and upset after 
talking with you once again.  It is sometimes difficult to be the person in 
the middle.  

I've spoken with Mr. Stowers, who denies using any curse words in his 
discussion with you, although he admits telling you that your repeated 
telephone calls and e-mails concerning the Busshaus case have diverted 
considerable time and attention away from prosecuting far more egregious 
cases of teacher wrongdoing.       

As I wrote in my last letter to you, I would take your calls if I had 
anything new to report on the status of the Busshaus case.  When you called 
last week, I had nothing to report and asked Mrs. Roberts to refer your call 
to Mr. Stowers in case he did have new information.  In making the referral, 
I told Mr. Stowers to tell you that we could not continue to have you take 
up such an inordinate amount of our work time for no apparent reason other 
than to vent your frustration with the Department's handling of the Busshaus 
litigation.  Surely you understand there are other members of staff and the 
public who deserve attention from the Office of General Counsel, and I have 
a responsibility to see that they get it. 

As you know, we hope to get on the February agenda of the Education 
Practices Commission with a settlement agreement, a copy of which I sent you 
a couple of weeks ago.  I understand the agreement has been signed by Mrs. 
Busshaus and her attorney.  If approved, the agreement would result in a 
letter of reprimand, substance abuse evaluation and treatment, periodic 
testing, and 3-years probation. 

There is nothing else to report, nor will there be before the Commission 
meeting.  Once again, please forgive the breach of decorum. 

Sincerely, 

James A. Robinson 
General Counsel

Subject: DOE General Counsel 


Mr. Robinson: 

    You and your staff are  public servants.  As  public servants 
responsible 
for prosecuting disciplinary actions involving wrongdoing by educators, you 
and your staff act on behalf of and for the protection of children who 
attend 
public schools.  My family is included among those who should be the 
beneficiary of the work that you and every other lawyer and staff member in 
your office have been hired to perform.  I would expect that you and your 
office staff would understand your relationship to the citizens of this 
state.  

    Obviously your staff does not understand that relationship.  As evidence 

I draw your attention to the unacceptable behavior exhibited by your staff 
during a telephone call with me this past week.  During that conversation 
your secretary, Paula, told me that she was going to put me on hold for a 
moment.  Then I heard her say "Sorry, there is a pain in the  ass woman on 
the other line." When I informed her that the "pain in the ass woman" she 
was 
speaking of was still on the line, she backtracked and said she had been 
talking about another woman who had made a public records request pertaining 

to FCAT.  Perhaps she was.  It really does not matter.  I am sure the "other 

woman" is also a citizen of this state who deserves the same respect and 
service as any other person seeking information from their government.  But 
that respect is apparently lacking within your department. 

    Another example of your department's disrespect for citizens expressing 
interest in your department's performance was the unacceptable language used 

by Mr. Stowers, who I understand is a lawyer in your office,  to sum up his 
opinion about my perseverance in the case involving my daughter's former 
teacher.   He stated that my perseverance in following up on that teacher's 
case has cost your department thousands of dollars and that the progress of 
the case  is "none of your damn business".  Mr. Stowers followed up on that 
comment by threatening to swear out a "harassment" complaint because of 
telephone calls that I have made in an effort to make sure that your 
department follows through on what he characterized as "just a piddly 
little 
DUI case".  For the record, Mr. Stowers felt it necessary to yell during the 

majority of the conversation despite my requests that he stop yelling.  I am 

unsure if you informed Mr. Stowers of your letter to me, copied to Robin 
Safley and David Ashburn, requesting all my inquiries regarding this matter 
only go through you.  For the record, I was doing that.  Your secretary, 
Paula, asked me the day before to call back in an hour or so to find out 
what 
the status of the settlement agreement was.  The next day your secretary, 
Paula, directed my return call to Mr. Stowers.  I was informed by Mr. 
Stowers 
of the state's threat to swear out a complaint.  

    Those types of  comments are completely outrageous, unacceptable and an 
affront to me and every other citizen in this state.  I would suggest that 
you have a heart to heart talk with your staff and then issue an immediate 
apology.  You, as department head, set the tone for what you will tolerate 
with respect to staff behavior.  At this time I find your staff's behavior 
to 
be completely unacceptable. 

    Please govern yourself accordingly. 
    
                        Sincerely, 

                        Shannon Knox    

P.S.  If the case involving my daughter's former teacher's is, in fact, 
"just 
a piddly little DUI", why will it have taken over a year to reach the 
settlement?

Subject:	MAIL ORDER PILOT PROGRAM FOR DIABETES

Dear Jeb.....
It is my understanding that the mail order pilot program for diabetes for patients along the I-4 corridor (Central Florida) requires that patients receive their diabetic medications and supplies through an out of state provider Health Alliance.  Not only is that an outrage for businesses within this state but that it makes no sense at all medically.- it is dangerous to the patient.  Our pharmacy presently provides medication management for the Senior Resource Alliance which includes 5 counties in Central Florida.  We monitor not only their diabetes but also the diseases which are a direct result on non-compliance,  inappropriate use of medication, failure to properly educate, etc.  And- it is at no charge to anyone including the Medicaid program. There is no way to control the health of these people with the therapy bifurcated and with incomplete patient history at our pharmacy.   It is inconceivable that you would allow this to go to a company which up to this point has not performed in a satisfactory matter when you have a woman owned business in this state (and a staunch Republican member of the Republican Congressional Committee Business Advisory Council) right here in Central Florida (Orlando).  I understand that you will be in Orlando tomorrow and I would hope that you would have a few moments to speak with me as I have been invited by Rich Crotty to attend-as a member of OCREC.  Please e-mail me concerning this.  Thank you.

Over the past few weeks we have continued to work with the travel industry relative to potential partnerships and the $20 million co-op advertising plan.  The Co-op Advertising Guidelines were forwarded to the industry during mid-November and to date we have been in discussion with 65 tourism organizations/companies relative to the economic stimulus monies.  Currently we have received 40 proposals from the industry which are now under review and some decisions will be made and announced by next week.  

We shall keep you appraised of the partnerships involved in the deals, along with the total dollars anticipated.  I would expect that we will continue to receive various proposals from the industry throughout the first quarter of 2002.

Our marketing strategy continues as previously reported and the only other significant activity is that we have approximately 1,000 offerings in our Hot Deals section of the Website, and are completing other offerings with the Florida Department of the Lottery for a January announcement of the FLAUSA game.

Our next update will be Monday, December 17.  If you have any questions, please advise.

Hi, Brett,

Please review and let me know if you would like changes.  Keep in mind I would not presume to tell the Governor what to say and these remarks are only a suggestion, which I hope will be helpful in taping the introduction.  
 
Thanks for all your help in this project.  I believe the CD will be ready for production as soon as we can add the Governor's remarks.  We plan to begin distribution the first of the year.
 
All the best,

Hi, my name is Jeb Bush and Im the Governor of Florida.  

 

When Ponce de Leon first happened on our Gulf Coast, he was searching for the Fountain of Youth.  Each year many visitors to our state, realize what he really found was a paradise.  

 

For more than 30 years my family and I have vacationed in beautiful Southwest Florida.  

 

Its glistening beaches and emerald waters are rated among the best in the world, and its mild, tropical climate insures nearly everyday is filled with sunshine.

 

Whether youre interested in a quick, get-away vacation or life-long move, this island coast is a great destination.  Youll find a blend of upscale and down home.  Depending on you taste, you can choose from exclusive golf communities, quite tree shaded neighborhoods or sun-drenched shores.  

 

Discover for yourself why so many corporations are recognizing the benefits of relocating to Southwest Florida.  

 

At work or at play, Floridas Gulf Coast is a great place to live and do business.  

 

Come on down!  

 

Discover Southwest Florida.

I have two agendas.  My insurance business may be in crisis.  The other is to get you re-elected.  Anything positive here, even if just PR, gives us more ammunition in our efforts for helping you.

Dear Governor Bush:

1. Negroid ----->2. Mongoloid -----> 3. Caucasoid 

I am a little confused.  When did Hispanic become a race?  I was taught that Hispanic's are of the Caucasian race. Why is it a prerequisite that the person replacing Jodi Gleason be Hispanic? I certainly would hope that the best candidate be chosen regardless of what box they check on their questionnaire. I do not think we should be forced into any decision based on the outcry of any ethnic group, that has been mistakenly added as an additional choice for race. I think that you should talk to the Indians from Guatemala, that reside in Lake Worth, and ask them how they feel about being labeled Hispanic.

There appear to be candidates who are campaigning for the appointment, that have had a very short residency in Palm Beach County. Is the motive for seeking appointment purely self-serving?

I would hope that you would interview members of any prior boards that all of the candidates have served on in the past. Contact the schools that their children attend.  See how involved they are, and whether their involvement is positive or negative. I would hope that you would not force an appointment on Palm Beach County that will serve no purpose other than to appease an ethnic group. I would certainly expect you to choose a candidate that has a proven history of commitment to the students in Palm Beach County.

Please do your homework thoroughly prior to making this appointment, which has tremendous impact on the residents and children of Palm Beach County. Please do not turn this into a popularity contest amongst your colleagues. I would suggest qualifications, such as having been a former educator, as Mr. Cantley was, would better serve in justifying your appointment, than what ethnic group the person belongs to.


Sincere Thanks,


Chelle Konyk

A Times Editorial 


A shameful retreat on arsenic 
 St. Petersburg Times, 
published December 2, 2001 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

The arrogance and greed that have come to grip the Florida Legislature were 
on full display Tuesday in Tallahassee. There, lawmakers siding with 
big-business lobbyists killed a bill to outlaw arsenic-laced wood from 
Florida's public playgrounds. 

Of course, "We Bring You Arsenic" is not the message of their ad campaign. 
It's just the result. Lawmakers on the House Agriculture Committee should be 
ashamed for putting the $4-billion wood-treatment industry before the health 
of Florida's children. The Florida Chamber of Commerce blew a terrific 
chance. It could have improved the image of Florida business by showing that 
corporations were responsible enough to balance their profits with public 
safety. Instead the chamber threw its weight behind chemical processors and 
the forestry industry. Rep. Larry Crow of Palm Harbor watched the committee 
kill his bill 6-3. 

The bill is dead, but with any justice the fallout won't be far away. 
Florida is on the leading edge of the treated-lumber debate. More 
arsenic-treated wood is sold here than anywhere else. A series of stories by 
the St. Petersburg Times' Julie Hauserman has prodded federal, state and 
local regulators to take a fresh look at the safety of arsenic-treated wood. 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is testing playgrounds across the 
country, Congress wants some answers and two of the largest home-improvement 
chains face class-action lawsuits by consumers who claim the lumber leaked 
harmful chemicals onto their property. Lawmakers will regret their vote if 
claims of safety by the industry are blown apart by the courts, regulators 
or science. 

There's nothing particularly radical about wanting safer alternatives to 
treated wood. What's perverse about Crow's opponents is that they want to 
see harm before doing the right thing.

Mayor Penelas has been aggressively seeking support for a voluntary early 
childhood (pre-K) development and education program. He's provided a "white 
paper", as well as his info relative to getting a pre-K program on the 
ballot in the near future. Others have indicated to me that this idea has 
actually been floating around Tally for several years. Based on what has 
been provided, this seems to be a good, viable program. 

That said, Micky Arison, myself and other friends who have been approached 
don't want to lend our support unless this is something that you are 
supportive of, or at least "neutral" on. We'd appreciate it if somebody 
could let us know.

Subject:	Nurse Practitioners/FMA and DEA/Controlled Medication prescribing


I know you did not ask my opinion but.... 

I have had the pleasure of working closely with 2 Nurse Practitioners who 
were wonderful clinicians. 
We worked well as a team. They reviewed their diagnosis and treatment plans 
with me for all the patients they treated. 
After getting to know them and working beside them, I had little concern 
that they would go beyond their training. 

Not all doctors have worked as closely with their nurse practioners and not 
all doctors who are supposed to be 
supervising nurse practitioners are on site in the facility where the care 
is being rendered -although I thought they were required to be. 

I suspect the biggest concerns/objections physicians will raise are 
-Any expansion in the scope of practice that may be perceived as an increase 
in competition 
-Nurse Practioners still have to be supervised by doctors and doctors will 
still ultimately be held responsible for the patient's well being. 


#1 is just the natural order of things.  The health care industry is 
evolving like other industries and people's roles will change 

#2 might be more acceptable if the level of supervision and accountability 
between doctors and nurses was clarified or enhanced. 
     For example, patient medical notes from each nurse practioner's 
patient visit have to be reviewed and/or co-signed by doctors now.  
     Maybe it could be required that the nurse practitioner have her/his 
notes and cases presented to the physician for review within a clearly 
defined time period like within 
     24 hours, by close of business, or at the end of a shift so that any 
questions or concerns the physician may have about the treatment course can 
     be addressed sooner rather than later.  Florida Statutes define the 
supervisory role physicians have to play. Maybe expanding on it or 
clarifying it will help. 

Not all physicians are represented by the FMA. In fact most aren't  Some 
depend heavily on nurses as patient care extenders in order for their 
practices (and their patients) to survive

I assume right now, florida agriculture community is biggest opponent of this.  if that assumption is correct, i would suggest doing a separate short paragraph to address the governor's intention to advocate for terms that will protect florida growers against unfair trade practices such as dumping, etc.  or, even better, is there anything we can say now, such as the president has assured us that they will vigorously protect against unfair trade practices.  i don't know what conversations we have had with administration on this.
 
by way of history, Clinton promised to protect florida growers from dumping as part of their "look the other way" support on NAFTA.  Clinton then did little to help once the dumping began.  Growers are weary of similar overtures from new administration and similar failure to follow through.  we need to assure them that this is not the Clinton admininstration and that they will take dumping and other unfair trade practices very seriously.

Congressman Putnam just called.  He heard from NAM (National Assoc of Mfgs) that you would be sending a letter to the Delegation urging support for the passage of the Trade Promotion Authority legislation (TPA).  This is something Pam and Tony Villamil have been working on.  We are re-drafting the letter after discussions with Pam and should have it to you by COB tomorrow.
 
The House vote is scheduled for next Thursday (12/6) and Mr. Putnam wanted to pass on his concerns over Floridas agricultural issues.  He wanted to make sure were on the same song sheet.

Dear Governor Bush, 

I was recently at a Restoration of Rights workshop in St. Petersburg and a 
couple of questions arose that I thought would best be answered by you. 

From the discussion, it sounded like applicants who submit their paperwork 
don't hear from the Clemency Board about a number of different items such as 
the following: if their applications have been received; if there is any 
paperwork missing; when their petitions will be heard; or if the 
applications have been refused, why they were refused. 

If this is accurate, as Governor, what is your position on the Clemency 
Board's lack of response to applicants? Are there good reasons for the lack 
of response? Is there something else that applicants need to do to receive 
status updates from the Clemency Board during the process? 

Thanks very much for your consideration. I look forward to your response. 

Happy Thanksgiving.

Here is the deal.  It appears that children already in KidCare, Title XXI, 
who become Medicaid eligible can stay in KidCare and we can get the higher 
match during the remainder of their continuous eligibility period (i.e., 12 
months) [according to CMS Regional Office, other states have been approved 
for this].  Have to ask for Federal approval.  But children can't initially 
choose KidCare if they are Medicaid eligible.

Dear Mr. Glisson, Honorable Gov. Jeb Bush, and Florida State Legislators: 

        I live in west Escambia County where the surrounding Pitcher 
Plant properties abound. Not only am I in favor of funding for the 
acquisition of more acreage for the purpose of "preservation of the 
plant", but I am also in favor of acquisition to help preserve the NAS 
that is so important to our economy. Furthermore, there seems to be so 
many difficulties with containing the development of Perdido Key and 
Perdido Bay areas, the added benefit of funding the acquisiton of the 
prairie property would be to aid the county in curbing over development. 
Another benefit is to lessen traffic problems on Sorrento Road West. I 
support all efforts to fund the purchase of Pitcher Plant Prairie 
properties. Thank you for your interest. Be assured that we residents and 
garden club members are extremely supportive of all you do in the 
interest of our environment and protection against over development. 
Sincerely, Mimi Jackson, 5161 Pale Moon Dr., Pensacola, Fl. 32507.

A lawyer for Harris notified leaders of the state-owned Playhouse in a letter Thursday that if they don't agree to certain conditions involving the property by Friday, he would recommend eviction.

It would be good publicity for Florida since a young Florida teen volunteer is making such an incredible difference in this world.  His volunteerism can change the world for millions of orphans worldwide. 

We know that you are extremely busy.  We just need to know if you can help us.  If you can, please let us know as soon as possible.  We want to deliver supplies to Romania by Christmas. Thank you for listening and may you and your family have blessed Christmas. 

Peace and blessings, 
Connie Simon 


Dear Mr. Conners and Ms. Comaneci, 

We know that you rarely respond to private email.  However, this is an urgent matter and we hope you will make an exception. Our son, Anton Nicolai (Nick) Simon, was adopted from a Romanian orphanage in 1990. He spent his first 5 1/2 years in one of Romania's poorest orphanages. Last summer, he heard about the children who weren't adopted.  They are kids our son's age who are being released to the streets without any family, skills or education. Many live in sewers beneath Bucharest and beg for food to survive.  This upset our son, Nick, tremendously. 

He decided to do something to help them.  He started a program called Backpack Carepak to collect new and nearly new backpacks, scarves, gloves, sweatshirts, combs, caps, and socks to help them endure the harsh winter months ahead.   

Nick's story has inspired many people to better appreciate how wonderful it is to have the gift of a family.  Hundreds of young people in our local schools have donated winterwear and backpacks.  Now our greatest obstacle is finding transportation.  We were going to have a concert to raise money for transportation costs, but the anthrax threat and high cost of insurance and security put that idea on hold indefinitely. 

Please read Nick's story located at the following web site.  It will take just a couple of minutes and we hope that you think it is worthwhile. 
http://joanbramsch.com/helpothers/backpack.shtml 

After reading it, if you want to help us, our greatest need is transportation.  If you know anyone with airline connections to Bucharest or a large plane that will transport supplies from Florida to Romania, would you please make the contacts to help us? We would deeply appreciate any help you can give Nick's project.   

Many people have been helping to make this project a success.  Kids at one school raised 500 dollars in pennies to buy backpacks.  An elderly lady knitted 100 hats for street kids.  A woman from Minnesota has made over 300 polar fleece scarves. Groups of all ages want to help these kids because Nick has inspired them to care about others who have so little. 

Nick is an outstanding young man who has overcome incredible challenges.  We are very proud of him.  We think he was the only one to get out of Orphanage #4 because he was meant to be a spokesperson for those who have no voice.  Nick wants to make a difference in this world.  Will you help him if you can?   

Nick wants to help the orphans in Romania first and then expand humanitarian aid in the future to orphans in China, Brazil, Afghanistan, Russia, and Africa.  There are millions of abandoned children worldwide in desperate need of help.  Not one major advocacy program exists today to advocate solely for orphans or abandoned children.  Nick wants to start one and will call it O.W.L.S. for Orphans Without Love or Shelter.   

Over the years, advocates have helped many worthy causes such as whales, turtles, trees, owls.  They have saved many species from harm or extinction.  We think even more people care about orphans.  We want to join together to advocate for children worldwide who need protection and shelter. Incredibly, a former orphan from Romania is leading the way. 

Thank you for reading this email and if you can help us locate a plane to deliver Backpack Carepaks to Romania before Christmas, we would be so grateful.  Any help or direction you can give this project will be deeply appreciated.  God bless you and your family. 

Most sincerely, 
The Simon Family

Dear Governor Bush, 

I was recently at a Restoration of Rights workshop in St. Petersburg and a 
couple of questions arose that I thought would best be answered by you. 

From the discussion, it sounded like applicants who submit their paperwork 
don't hear from the Clemency Board about a number of different items such as 
the following: if their applications have been received; if there is any 
paperwork missing; when their petitions will be heard; or if the 
applications have been refused, why they were refused. 

If this is accurate, as Governor, what is your position on the Clemency 
Board's lack of response to applicants? Are there good reasons for the lack 
of response? Is there something else that applicants need to do to receive 
status updates from the Clemency Board during the process? 

Thanks very much for your consideration. I look forward to your response. 

Happy Thanksgiving. 

Kathy Honan

Dear Mr. Glisson, Honorable Gov. Jeb Bush, and Florida State Legislators: 

        I live in west Escambia County where the surrounding Pitcher 
Plant properties abound. Not only am I in favor of funding for the 
acquisition of more acreage for the purpose of "preservation of the 
plant", but I am also in favor of acquisition to help preserve the NAS 
that is so important to our economy. Furthermore, there seems to be so 
many difficulties with containing the development of Perdido Key and 
Perdido Bay areas, the added benefit of funding the acquisiton of the 
prairie property would be to aid the county in curbing over development. 
Another benefit is to lessen traffic problems on Sorrento Road West. I 
support all efforts to fund the purchase of Pitcher Plant Prairie 
properties. Thank you for your interest. Be assured that we residents and 
garden club members are extremely supportive of all you do in the 
interest of our environment and protection against over development. 
Sincerely, Mimi Jackson, 5161 Pale Moon Dr., Pensacola, Fl. 32507.

We can not do any releases or other coverage. I heard from NBC this morning 
and they wanted to pull the donation because we are a state agency and not 
a 501C3 non profit. I have scrambled around to line up some of my community 
501C3's to accept the donation for us. They are afraid that should any 
press coverage result stating we (DCF) had received a donation from them 
they would be swamped with calls from other states and governors. I assured 
them we would handle it through other avenues and I would get back to them. 
As of right now the State foster parents association, Special Opportunity 
Fund of South Florida and the Foster Care Council of Southwest Florida will 
accept the donation. My office will still manage it but officially it is 
theirs. The National Guard called this morning and will assist within 
allowable guidelines. Thanks Governor! 
I will let you all know the final arrangements.

Dear Governor Bush, 

I appreciate all you are doing on behalf of the State workers and all appreciate your efforts no matter how small.  

I wish more could have been done on behalf of those making less than $25,000. 

Having been in your camp from the "getgo" may I say that in my humble opinion above $50,000 falls within the modest salary range.

November 30, 2001 

To All State Employees: 

I am pleased to report that all eligible non-temporary state employees 
earning $90,000 a year or less have received a pay increase of 2.5 percent, 
effective November 1, 2001.  I believe it's important to preserve the pay 
increase passed by the Legislature in May for those earning more modest 
salaries.  

However, special appreciation must be extended to those forgoing their 
annual pay raise to help balance our state budget.  As you know, a decline 
in state revenues due in large part to the terrorist attacks of September 11 
and the drop in airline travel has necessitated cuts in the current year's 
budget.  

Those who join me in making this sacrifice are helping us preserve essential 
services to our people, while funding our new initiatives in domestic 
security and economic stimulus.  Floridians will be safer, and the coming 
economic recovery will be accelerated for all our people, in part because of 
this sacrifice. 

I hope every state employee shares with me a renewed sense of purpose 
following the terrorist attacks of September 11.  It is a great privilege to 
serve the people of the Sunshine State, and an even greater privilege to 
serve during times that challenge us.  Your hard work and dedication is 
valued.

Jeb Bush

Denver,
 
This morning, I contacted Tony McNeal (permitting administrator with Beaches and Coastal Systems).  He had previously spoken with Ms Blake regarding her inquiry into coastal armoring at the Villager Condominiums in Indialantic.  Unfortunately, the Villager Condominium has not yet submitted a permit application to the Department.  While the Governor has declared a coastal emergency, the local governments apparently have not approved emergency armoring for the Villager Condominium due to the distance of the bluff to the condominium (approximately 29 feet).  I spoke with Ms. Blake this morning and advised her the she could still apply with the Department for armoring under the emergency order.  We had a general conversation about the requirements and options available to her (wood retaining wall, rock revetment, etc.).  Also, we chatted about the need to demonstrate vulnerability in order to be eligible for coastal armoring.  She and the residents of the Villager are concerned that they cannot wait until the scheduled 2003 beach restoration project.  She will be putting together a permit application and submitting it to the Department within the near future.  I encouraged her to contact me if she had any questions or ran into any problems.
 
Let me know if you have any questions.
 
Thanks
 
Mike

Dear Mr. Bush, 
Thank you for your response to my email but the concern we have is that with 
29 feet between our building and the cliff edge we well not be able to 
withstand two more seasons of Northeasterly storms and God forbid we have to 
endure a hurricane.  
Also help me understand why it is, that it is so difficult to obtain permits 
for preventive measures rather than waiting for emergency conditions.  Our 
building is 13 stories and for us to wait until the cliff edge is 10 to 15 
ft. from the building before  armoring structures are considered, seems to be 
very foolish.   Everywhere I turn I am told no armoring structures, then I go 
down to Melbourne Beach and they received a permit from the DEP for an 
armoring structure.  But, this permit was not obtained until he was in an 
emergency condition.  Please, any help you can direct me to would be much 
appreciated.  We believe NOW is the time to act. 
Sincerely, 
Nancy Blake

I assume right now, florida agriculture community is biggest opponent of this.  if that assumption is correct, i would suggest doing a separate short paragraph to address the governor's intention to advocate for terms that will protect florida growers against unfair trade practices such as dumping, etc.  or, even better, is there anything we can say now, such as the president has assured us that they will vigorously protect against unfair trade practices.  i don't know what conversations we have had with administration on this.
 
by way of history, Clinton promised to protect florida growers from dumping as part of their "look the other way" support on NAFTA.  Clinton then did little to help once the dumping began.  Growers are weary of similar overtures from new administration and similar failure to follow through.  we need to assure them that this is not the Clinton admininstration and that they will take dumping and other unfair trade practices very seriously.

Congressman Putnam just called.  He heard from NAM (National Assoc of Mfgs) that you would be sending a letter to the Delegation urging support for the passage of the Trade Promotion Authority legislation (TPA).  This is something Pam and Tony Villamil have been working on.  We are re-drafting the letter after discussions with Pam and should have it to you by COB tomorrow.
 
The House vote is scheduled for next Thursday (12/6) and Mr. Putnam wanted to pass on his concerns over Floridas agricultural issues.  He wanted to make sure were on the same song sheet.
 
More tomorrow.  Nina.

To The Honorable Governor Jeb Bush;
    Dear sir, I, Ronald B. Reid as a member of the Republican Party and a member of the Tampa Bay Black Republican Club am asking for you to appoint Gladstone A "Tony" Cooper Jr. to the position of BOARD OF GOVERNORS FOR THE CITY OF TAMPA PORT AUTHORITY.
    
    I know Tony Cooper to be a motivated businessman fluent in the language of Spanish who with a background in banking, vast international business experience and has traveled to over 37 countries.  He has over 10 years experience in international trade with the last 12 years focusing on construction and real estate management.  
 
    I also know Tony Cooper to be a man of community involvement serving along side me in the Tampa Bay Black Republican Club and being a active member of the Hillsborough Republican Party shining a positive light on our party and our community through his leadership and involvement.  
 
    Therefore I believe there could be no other choice as qualified to represent this party and your administration in this position.  
 
                                                                                       Thank you for your time

The Dept. reached out to Mr. McCool and explained several serious misconceptions he had (about the number of times they had taken down his marker and the way they had treated other people's markers).  They told him that they wouldn't interfere with his marker during the holidays.  They explained the DOT Marker Program, which was established precisely so that people could have markers, without being allowed to put up anything they feel like putting up without limits.  I think DOT helped.  The only other response would have been "You can put up whatever you want."  But if they aren't telling every other Floridian this, why is Mr. McCool entitled to be told this?  I will get with DOT and see how the follow-up went with him.

I need help in getting DOT off my case and figuring out why the memorial cross which I put on the side of the highway at the location of my son's death (to a traffic accident) keeps being removed.  I understand the Party Line. There is a regulation......yadda... yadda... yadda. Yet there are scores of other locations in Central Florida where the roadside memorial are not removed.  I have replaced the little white cross 15 times along with a $30 arrangement of silk flowers and I will continue to replace the memorial and flowers.  I just don't understand why the DOT is being so vigilant in my case and totally ignoring all the others. MOST notably there are two locations where Orange county police officer have been killed. Not only is there a massive collection of flower and crosses at these locations, the Orlando Sentinel even did a story about how those memorials were part of the grief and healing process for the family and friends of the deceased.  
I have to read that, agree with everything they say and then go out in a day or two and spend more time and money trying to keep one step ahead of the DOT highway pickup crew.  It isn't fair. PERIOD.  My 18 year old son dying in a car accident wasn't fair either, but there is no one to talk to about that, it can't be undone. 
It's not like this is an eyesore or a cluttered mess. It is a simple white cross and bouquet of silk flowers.  We long ago removed all the little momento the high school kids put out and we keep it neat, so no one has reason to complain. 
SO, my question.  How do I get DOT to leave this roadside memorial alone.  It isn't hurting anyone. It doesn't look bad. And it is much smaller than most of the other similar roadside memorials in this area (which do not get removed).
 
Please help.
The location is at the intersection of SR 46 at Lake Forrest Blvd. (one mile west of I-4 on Route 46)
Thank you.

Dear Gov. Bush, 
I understand that all the budget for the SWAT program  has been taken back and that the state will not be able to fund the anti-smoking programs for kids. 

Can you let me know specifically what has happened to the funds and when they might become available again?

I just talked with the House budget writers and the budget is one the desk 
of legislators at this time.  The final cuts are as follows: 

$62,500 Governor's Mentoring Initiative 
$1.3 Take Stock in Children 
$1.0 Big Brothers 
$502,000 Boys and Girls Clubs 

When I have an official copy, should it differ in any way from the above, I 
will let you know immediately. 

Obviously, one policy was not used across the board.  GMI took a cut in the 
base of about 5%; Take Stock and Big Brothers lost all new funding; and Boys 
and Girls Clubs lost approximately half of new funding.

Florida Ag is increasing its monitoring of fruits and keeping a close watch

Mr. McCool: 

Governor Bush has asked me to respond to you recent email (attached below) 
regarding the marker you have placed in the median of State Road 46 in 
Seminole County.  First, we wish to express our sympathy for your tragic 
loss. 

The Department's Memorial Marker program was instituted several years ago 
due to safety concerns as a result of the placement of private markers 
along our highways.  In addition to the act of placement itself, some 
markers were of such a size and structure that they constituted hazards. 
Others obstructed sight distance at intersections.  Additionally, there 
were maintenance concerns, and objections expressed by nearby residents and 
businesses.  In some instances, markers were being placed over the 
objections of the victim's family. 

Still, the Department recognized the need for some people to express their 
grief in this manner.  Our program standardized the markers, and served the 
dual purpose of promoting safety on our highways.  I am aware you have 
elected to participate in this program, and a marker has been placed along 
SR 46 per your request.  Most of those who have participated in our program 
have expressed understanding of our inability to selectively permit private 
markers that are seemingly unobtrusive and present no obvious safety or 
maintenance problems. 

It is our hope you will come to understand that our policy is intended as a 
sympathetic yet responsible option.  Your email indicated your marker had 
been removed on far more occasions than those for which our staff was 
responsible.  This may happen again, or your marker may be cited as an 
example of why others should be allowed.  You yourself cited examples that, 
as our staff was able to explain, were not on the State Road system.  We 
cannot prevent the removal of the marker by others, nor can we ignore 
protests of selective enforcement.  In the absence of any of the concerns 
to which we are obliged to be responsive, I have asked our District staff 
to allow your median marker to remain in place through the holiday season. 

I send you our sincere wishes for a blessed holiday, and our hope the 
passage of time will help heal the pain of such a loss. 

Sincerely, 

Tom Barry

Florida Department of Transportation

Governor, 

The marker program was begun about five years ago because we had major 
safety concerns for motorists stopping to place memorials on our highways. 
It has generally been well received by families and friends.  Markers can 
have name(s) on them if the relatives desire. 

Mr McCool has requested, and we have installed, the Department's standard 
memorial marker on the side of SR 46.  We continue to have concerns that he 
is placing his memorial in the median of the highway.  My staff has talked 
with him at length, but he believes that he should be allowed to place the 
marker where he wants it. 

We have also found out that someone other than the Department has been 
removing his markers.  His e-mail says it has been removed 15 times, but we 
have removed it no more than four or five times.  The other locations he 
mentions in his note to you are not on the state highway system 

We plan to leave the site alone through the holidays.

Dear Governor Bush, 

I was recently at a Restoration of Rights workshop in St. Petersburg and a 
couple of questions arose that I thought would best be answered by you. 

From the discussion, it sounded like applicants who submit their paperwork 
don't hear from the Clemency Board about a number of different items such as 
the following: if their applications have been received; if there is any 
paperwork missing; when their petitions will be heard; or if the 
applications have been refused, why they were refused. 

If this is accurate, as Governor, what is your position on the Clemency 
Board's lack of response to applicants? Are there good reasons for the lack 
of response? Is there something else that applicants need to do to receive 
status updates from the Clemency Board during the process? 

Thanks very much for your consideration. I look forward to your response.

To The Honorable Governor Jeb Bush;
    Dear sir, I, Ronald B. Reid as a member of the Republican Party and a member of the Tampa Bay Black Republican Club am asking for you to appoint Gladstone A "Tony" Cooper Jr. to the position of BOARD OF GOVERNORS FOR THE CITY OF TAMPA PORT AUTHORITY.
    
    I know Tony Cooper to be a motivated businessman fluent in the language of Spanish who with a background in banking, vast international business experience and has traveled to over 37 countries.  He has over 10 years experience in international trade with the last 12 years focusing on construction and real estate management.  
 
    I also know Tony Cooper to be a man of community involvement serving along side me in the Tampa Bay Black Republican Club and being a active member of the Hillsborough Republican Party shining a positive light on our party and our community through his leadership and involvement.  
 
    Therefore I believe there could be no other choice as qualified to represent this party and your administration in this position.  
 
                                                                                       Thank you for your time

Dear Gov. Bush: Since January of 1997, I have been trying to complete my
seawall needed to protect what is left of my oceanfront property & my home
in Indian River Bounty. I have been in communication with you on this
matter since February 2000. As you may recall, this 5 year controversy is
over the position of the DEP that the wall is 15 feet too far seaward, and
therfore represents a "take" of turtle habitat. We have through your
efforts, those of local officials, and our own been given a permit to move
the wall as few as 8 feet. We continue to request that we be allowed to
complete the wall in its as-built location for several reasons. The primary
reason is the expense. At $850 a foot, it would cost $78,200 to move this
wall even 1 foot. Some quotes are as high as $1000.00 a foot. We have also
resisted moving the wall for reasons of value to our primary asset, because
we have documented the inconsistencies regarding the placement of permitted
wals elsewhere, and because we know that moving our wall is not going to
make a significant difference. The scuttlebut is that the unwillingness of
the decision makers to reach the obvious conclusion regarding the "Gerstner
Wall" is their fear of setting a precendent. It is not this decision that
willset a precendent; the inconsistent application of the rules and regs has
already established that "opening". What hasn't yet happened is a court
case to expose those Inconsistencies. Noone wants to be the one to take on
that task, and is it really necessary? Chairwoman Ginn if in Tallahassee
today and may contact you to make this same appeal. I know there are
agencies that could not tolerate a $100,000 budget cut. Please consider
what it represents to me and my family and weigh that cost against the gain.
You are acutely aware of the critical condition of our beaches. Seawalls
are only temporary structures that buy time until the conditions dictating
their need can be cured. We need sand by-pass srojects at inlets &
nourishing programs. I would not contact you again if I did not think it
was going to take your influence to get this done. Thank you, Cheryl

Dear Governor Bush, 

Living and working in Tallahassee for over 18 years, I can tell you that a State 
Technology Office is needed.  So much redundancy can be eliminated  The IT 
community within the State has pretty much written off the idea with the sudden 
departure of Roy Cales. 

Please consider me for the position of Chief Information Officer for the State 
of Florida.  I have thought long and hard about this decision, to serve the 
citizens of Florida, and feel my qualifications can be well utilized. 

I truly believe in your model to have state government run like a business. 
This can be accomplished.  With an Information Technology (IT) budget of over 
$800 million, a significant savings can be realized by selecting someone that 
knows Florida, IT and how Florida/IT has worked and can work! 

I have bid on many IT opportunities with the State - winning many!  From my 
vantage point there are many things that can change - some very small - that can 
substantially save money.  The STO office is a great idea and is needed! 

Prior to joining Computer Aid, Inc three years ago, which I am currently 
Business Unit Manager of Florida, I owned and operated a certified minority IT 
firm.  I have many good ideas to bring to the One Florida initiative as well. 

Being in private industry the last 14 years, in Tallahassee, when we hire 
someone to provide IT service to the State we try to find someone with State 
experience.  Because we know that person will understand the State and bring 
this value to our organization.  I can bring that value to the State.  I 
understand private industry's view of IT.  With my knowledge gained from working 
for the State and servicing the State, I can bring these experiences to the CIO 
position. 

I also know how to make a profit - realizing this is not what the State wants to 
accomplish - these strategies can be brought to the State to reduce cost and 
bring better service to the citizens of Florida! 

My background includes: 
-    registered Republican when I was 18, 
-    Florida citizen for 26 years (since I was 13), 
-    worked for the State Government 
     (Department of Environmental Regulation - 1983-1987),

Dear Governor Bush, 

Living and working in Tallahassee for over 18 years, I can tell you that a State 
Technology Office is needed.  So much redundancy can be eliminated  The IT 
community within the State has pretty much written off the idea with the sudden 
departure of Roy Cales. 

Please consider me for the position of Chief Information Officer for the State 
of Florida.  I have thought long and hard about this decision, to serve the 
citizens of Florida, and feel my qualifications can be well utilized. 

I truly believe in your model to have state government run like a business. 
This can be accomplished.  With an Information Technology (IT) budget of over 
$800 million, a significant savings can be realized by selecting someone that 
knows Florida, IT and how Florida/IT has worked and can work! 

I have bid on many IT opportunities with the State - winning many!  From my 
vantage point there are many things that can change - some very small - that can 
substantially save money.  The STO office is a great idea and is needed! 

Prior to joining Computer Aid, Inc three years ago, which I am currently 
Business Unit Manager of Florida, I owned and operated a certified minority IT 
firm.  I have many good ideas to bring to the One Florida initiative as well. 

Being in private industry the last 14 years, in Tallahassee, when we hire 
someone to provide IT service to the State we try to find someone with State 
experience.  Because we know that person will understand the State and bring 
this value to our organization.  I can bring that value to the State.  I 
understand private industry's view of IT.  With my knowledge gained from working 
for the State and servicing the State, I can bring these experiences to the CIO 
position. 

I also know how to make a profit - realizing this is not what the State wants to 
accomplish - these strategies can be brought to the State to reduce cost and 
bring better service to the citizens of Florida! 

My background includes: 
-    registered Republican when I was 18, 
-    Florida citizen for 26 years (since I was 13), 
-    worked for the State Government 
     (Department of Environmental Regulation - 1983-1987), 
-    been working with the State, at an IT consulting firm, for over 10 years, 
-    started, ran, and sold a successful IT company (MBE certifed), and 
-    been part of the

Nothing yet from Tara on a possible meeting with you next Tuesday (or 
whenever...)...I'll call you all. 

Another issue:  Some time ago we invited you to be present at the Everglades 

Coalition meeting, as our guest, to open the conference on Thursday night 
(it's a legacy!).  As an added bonus, there is the possibility that the 
"RECOVER" Memorandum of Understanding (regarding the performance goals of 
Everglades Restoration) may be signed that night.  This, of course, would 
get great coverage and be a terrific opportunity to highlight your 
leadership on this issue, as well as to underline the progress to date (and 
funding?). 

That would be Thursday, 3 January, sometime around 6-7:30 PM, at the Ft. 
Lauderdale Marina Marriott.  

Cheers,

Subject: traffic light



Jeb, 

Would you help me in expediting the process of approving a traffic light? The 
area of concern is the N. Monroe / Universal Rd. (between Tallahassee mall 
and Hooters) This unique portion of N. Monroe is home for 12 restaurants. 
Turning left to access any of these establishments has resulted in many 
wrecks and close calls. A few of which I've personally witnessed while 
dining. Entering and leaving these restaurants during peek periods also 
results in delays and drive-thru backups. For example; the delay in leaving 
the Chic-Fil-A in the morning is 7 minutes waiting for the light at John knox 
to turn. 

I'm no traffic engineer but I believe the time duration of the light would be 
quick since Universal doesn't cross N. Monroe. So rather than a 4 way it 
would only be a 3 way light signal. Its location is precisely halfway between 
Northwood shopping center and John Knox Road. With 12 restaurants now on that 
stretch, a left hand turn during breakfast, lunch or dinner has become a life 
threatening task. Even if this light could be activated during those times 
and remain a flashing yellow the rest of the day would be an improvement. 

Eating establishments are: EL Chico, Arby's, Chic-fil-A, Roadhouse, Boston 
market, DQ, Miami subs, 4TH Quarter, Woody's BBQ, Rallys, Silver Slipper, 
Lindy's. 

Thanks for anything you can do, let me know what I can do as well.

Subject:	Non-profit response to my request to support Gov. Bush in blocking all "turkeys"

Dear Governor:
 
I failed in my attempt to gain the support of my non-profit peers to support your outlawing all turkeys this year if there are to be cuts in social service or education funding. Here's their explanation - some of us are asking for turkeys for this coming year. This may be our only opportunity to offset threatened cuts. It was unanimous - no one would support me. It's pathetic - executive directors are forced to abandon their values and ethics to do whatever it takes to gain much needed funds. They are more than willing to take a long shot at sneaking in through the turkey door rather than meet the issue of  funding cuts head on. I am embarrassed, but I hope that you can understand their desperation - it doesn't matter to them that this is a special year (I tried to explain that we are at war, the Florida economy is down - turkeys may have been the name of the game in the past - but not this year). After so many years of same rates for clients we have diligently served, they feel they have no choice but to go for turkeys - no matter what.                    
 
I still think the right thing to do is to freeze all talk of turkeys for the 2002-2003 budget.

Dear Governor:
 
Tonight on the evening news we are hearing about a state legislature that is prepared to make major cuts in spending on education and social services, while approving lots and lots of turkeys. I know how you feel about this. Tomorrow Florida ARC and representatives of Florida ARF will meet in Tampa. I will certainly raise this issue for discussion. I will call for the drafting of a position paper that supports you in not granting one turkey this year. What unmitigated gaul. Talk about being the laughing stock of the nation. What would any right-minded individual think about us if we allowed these duly elected representatives of ours to be so ruthless and self-serving. This is an issue worth demonstrating over, if necessary. I hope it doesn't come to that, but if it does - I hope that my fellow agency professionals will raise their voices in protest. The many must not be sacrificed for the benefit of the few.

Subject: HUGE DONATION



I know the Secretary emailed you about the huge donation we are going to 
receive from NBC and the TODAY Show. Sam Sagenkahn is the one who is in 
charge of the toy distribution. We will be receiving the majority (or a 
good part of) the Ringling donation which was about $650,000. The way we 
got it was when they announced that this donation would benefit children 
from Florida to Maine I called them and told them they weren't doing their 
part for Florida's kids. I almost croaked when they called me at home this 
morning and told me they would ship me 32,000. toys. THIRTY TWO THOUSAND 
PIECES!!! This is soooo fantastic! Anyway,  now I have another problem, I 
have to get this stuff all over the state. When I was in Jacksonville 
Friday for the ceremony honoring the Florida Air National Guard they 
happened to mention that you were their boss. Makes sense. SOOOO. What are 
the possibilities of you letting them help (if I can get some of them to 
volunteer) to  get this shipment spread out different places where there 
are kids that need it. I can have the toys drop shipped to 2 places and 
then I have to arrange distribution from there. Pensacola, Miami, 
Gainesville, Fort Peirce and Fort Myers will probably get a larger share 
but all the districts will get some. 
Can I ask the National Guard? 
We also received word on Friday that Sears is shipping another load of 
clothes and uniforms etc. south for us out of Atlanta right after 
Christmas. The last load was valued at $948,000.00. 
Not bad eh? 
Well thanks for the support and keep up the good work!

Dear Gov Bush:
I hear rumor that your brother is coming to Orlando next Wednesday for a tourist promotion or something like that.  This maybe false rumor, not from ABC News :).  But if he does come, it would be great if he could stop by Walt Disney World.  As you probably know this is our re-scheduled (from Sept) BIG event to promote the next 18 months for us and Florida for "Walt's 100 years of Magic!"  Wednesday is the 100th birthday of Walt...Dec 5 1901.  He really is an American original.  Anyway, is there anything I can do to make this happen?  I'm sure our folks have talked to The White House.  I'll find out tomorrow what they are saying, but tonight after going to the Laker game and a win in LA, I thought I'd write you this note.  The game was short and it's still early.

Senate soap opera: `Lust for Power' 

The Florida Senate, historically a tight-knit fraternity that rarely airs 
its dirty laundry, is swirling in a soap opera of personal feuds, 
Machiavellian maneuverings and political intrigue.Nobody knows who the next 
Senate president will be, or when exactly the designation will take place. 
But everybody involved realizes that whoever is elected could transform the 
face of Florida government.Traditionally, the new president is designated at 
least a year before legislative elections, and then officially chosen by a 
vote of the 40-member Senate in the days following the statewide 
elections.But now the elections are in 11 months, and no president has been 
designated. Instead, three very different men are locked in a dead heat, 
lining up support based on old friendships, political alliances and 
contrasting ideologies.The showdown, one senator put it last week, is a 
fascinating display of the ``lust for power'' that drives so many 
politicians.What is at stake?The very culture of the Senate as the 
moderating force in the state capital -- especially since conservative 
Republicans took over the House in 1996 and Jeb Bush won the governor's 
mansion in 1998 -- could change forever as term limits and an increasingly 
powerful group of conservative former House members-turned-senators move 
into leadership.The Republicans vying to be Senate president are Daniel 
Webster, a socially conservative former House speaker from Orlando; Jim King 
of Jacksonville, a more moderate but unabashedly pro-business former House 
majority leader; and Tom Lee of Plant City, a moderate maverick who is a 
relative political newcomer.Each represents a different style, and each has 
about a third of the GOP caucus in his camp. So far, the tally is Webster 
nine, Lee eight, King seven.MANY LAYERS There are several complicated levels 
of dynamics making this a difficult task.It is widely believed that Bush 
wants Webster to hold the gavel. The two are ideologically compatible, and 
Webster would likely carry the governor's agenda rather than obstruct it, 
like Presidents Toni Jennings and John McKay have done on issues such as 
campaign finance reform, growth management and taxes.Some say privately they 
have heard from Bush emissaries, gently suggesting that good job 
opportunities await them in Tallahassee or Washington if they help 
Webster.Asked last week if he has a preference in the race, Bush said: ``I 
just want them to pick someone.'' King said recently it would be a ``stupid 
political miscalculation'' for the governor to get involved in the 
race.King, meanwhile, is beloved by the Capitol's lobbyists for his desire 
to please businesses and has the support of a group of senators that 
believes Webster is too conservative.The King-Webster feud dates to the 
mid-1990s when Webster narrowly beat out King to be Republican leader in the 
House.Then there's Lee, who some view as a middle-of-the-road alternative. 
He is supported by a cadre of longtime senators who think Lee, not a former 
House member, can best preserve the traditions of the Senate.Some of Lee's 
supporters, however, face term limits next year. They will be here to vote 
for his designation, but will be replaced by freshmen whose votes, come next 
November, will be up for grabs.That means Lee could be designated, but 
Webster or King could take the presidency.Webster has one more advantage: As 
chairman of the Senate committee redrawing district lines, he will have 
great influence over which new senators get elected. That would likely 
include several former House comrades, who would cast Webster votes.Then 
there are the Democrats, the minority party. While they will not participate 
in the ceremonial designation -- a job only for the GOP caucus -- their 
votes could be used for an unprecedented coalition built to install a 
moderate president.``All of our options are open,'' said the Senate 
Democrats' next leader, Ron Klein. ``Certainly there have been conversations 
in our caucus about that, and some have suggested we approach one of the 
candidates about that.''MCKAY STRONG Perhaps the biggest winner is John 
McKay, the current president.Without an obvious successor, there is nobody 
to start sucking away his power.Typically a Senate president is at his most 
powerful during the year preceding  his term -- as he doles out jobs and 
promises -- and the first year of the term.McKay's grip on power remains 
firm, and he hopes his legacy will be a massive reform of Florida's tax 
system next year. But until a successor can be found, the Senate's future 
remains murky.Peter Wallsten is chief of The Herald Capital Bureau.

Good morning Beatrice -
 
I am so excited ready your email!  I can't wait to talk with you more about the A.B.L.E. Center for Osceola County.  As you can imagine, we need to keep this hush-hush for now because it is not fair to other communities.  But, you can definitely start thinking about "your" center!  We would like for you to be one of the leaders of the A.B.L.E. Center in Osceola county.  Your dreams of opening a special center for disabled people will now come true!  We have the system for funding, we have the organization, we have the resources to make the dream a reality.  There is a special group of philapthropists who wish to remain anonymous, who are providing the seed money for the 12 Centers.  This is such an awesome opportunity, Beatrice, and can you just imagine the impact we will have on each community and the lives of children and adults with disabilities and their families!  No longer will they be at the mercy of anyone else to provide for their needs.  No longer will they have to beg for services, programs, and funding for their needs.  
 
What town do you live in?  Our family is in Levy county which is just south west of Ganiesville and west of Ocala - it's about 1 1/2 to 2 hours from Orlando.  Our oldest 2 sons live in Orlando with their families.  We are so blessed to have them close by to visit with them often.  In fact, we just threw a surprise Sweet 16 birthday party for our son, Jonathan's girlfriend, Chantelle.  She was soooo surprised and it was a big success. She is such a sweet girl and her mom is an ESE teacher for the local high school.  
 
Thanks for the survey list.  You do have a lot of contacts and connections.  This is vital to the success of the A.B.L.E. Centers in each community.  The communities will be building the actual center!  Would you like to plan on January 15 for us to make the introduction to the community about the Osceola County A.B.L.E. Center?  We will have to hold the meeting in a place that will be able to accomodate many people as we expect a large turnout.  The meeting will be by invitation only and people MUST R.S.V.P. to receive their entrance ticket.
 
We'll talk more about the January meeting, if that is what you would like to do for that meeting.  Let me know if this is agreeable to you, and possible places to hold the meeting.
 
Warm regards,
Lori

Hi Lori,
 
Unfortunately we don't have a newsletter yet, but I know quite a bit of people and agencies that would put the advertisement in their newsletter or spread the word like CARD, FND, FDLRS, Family Care Council (I'll be pretty soon a member of the FCC for District seven). I also advertise in the local newspaper and as a Master Gardener for Osceola County, I can get a lot of help from
my friends and extension Agent Eleanor Foerste who is a wonderful Lady and knows a lot of people from the County.
I also post my flyer at the Library and I distribute 420 flyers through the schools, I had target the profound disables Children because I felt that they are the one with the greatest needs. I know also some people from 4C, since I took a lot
of classes there and recently I got my CDA (Child Development Associate). I have on my list 50 parents who contacted me, so
I could send an invitation to each of them. I know also a few Support Coordinator from DD who can tell the parents about the
A.B.L.E foundation, and I can have flyers posted in a few doctors offices and ask a few parents to post a flyer at grocery stores,
beside that I also know the director of Children First and therapists who can spread the word among their clients.
All I needed now is to compose the flyer for Tuesday January the 15th, do you have a sample that I can use?
My first language is French and you probably notice that I make mistakes in English, but I usually summit my flyer before distribution to the Superintendent of the ESE department for corrections and approval.
As far as work, I couldn't work outside home anymore because of the needs of my Child, beginning of this year Greta became
diabetic. I opened a Family Day Care and I decided to take care only of children with disabilities because like I said earlier,
they are the one who have nothing for them in our County, so far I am taking care of a young lady who is 18 with CP and is in
a motorized chair, I am also a Medwaiver provider, respite and companion and I take care of a 15 years old who in mentally
challenge and his sister 11 who is physically impaired and mentally challenged (there are not on the list that I give you since
their mom didn't do the survey yet). I take care of them during the weekend and I also am a companion for a wonderful 60 years old with CP who enjoy everything and always wants to help. So, I work after school and also on the weekend and that is all for the
moment. It does give me plenty of time to do many things when the children are at school. 
My dreams is to have a Center for the disables because at home there is some limitations, like for example I don't have a wheelchair ramp or an adapted play ground or adapted computer or adapted bathroom. My plan was to open a non-profit organization and open a thrift shop to support the center as well as organizing an annually raffle, and make plants to sale, even grow grapes to make juice and wine. I know there is a lot of possibilities. 
Hope that your questions are answered and I can't wait to hear from you.
 
Beatrice

Our Opinion editorial 11/25/2001 

On the backs 
of the vulnerable 

Gov. Jeb Bush believes he's fixed the state's budgetary woes by 
convincing 
enough Florida House members to postpone a $128 million reduction in the 
state intangibles tax on those who own more than $20,000 worth of stocks 
or 
bonds. 

That's good news, for sure. Divisiveness over the intangibles tax cut, 
especially between House Speaker Tom Feeney and Senate President John 
McKay, 
turned the first special session into a knock-down, drag-out political 
brouhaha, an embarrassment to the concept of public service. More 
important, 
what are we doing giving breaks to rich folks at a time when we must cut 
essential public programs that help poor and neglected children and old 
people, not to mention sick people? 

So while Bush and the Legislature, which convenes for a second special 
session on the budget Tuesday, may have found a balancing act that will 
meet 
constitutional muster by eliminating $1 billion in red ink, they should 
contain any celebratory exuberance. 

The fact is most of the spending cuts proposed will add up to one thing: 
The 
state budget, for the most part, will be balanced on the backs of those 
least able to help themselves - the young, the old, the impoverished. 

While Bush has been busy brokering a deal on the intangibles tax and 
talking 
it up, we have heard nothing about finding a way not to cut $167 million 
from our public classrooms, which already get short-shrift from the 
Legislature. Not a word about how to avoid cutting $66 million from a 
Department of Juvenile Justice that is stretched too thin and dealing 
with 
Florida's fastest-growing criminal segment. What about the $7.5 million 
slashed from the state's $30 million prescription drug program for poor 
elderly residents or the $20 million lost in prescription drug 
assistance 
for the poor? No deal brokered in any of these. 

With Bush up for re-election next year, look for a lovefest in 
Tallahassee 
this week after the Feeney-McKay public-relations debacle the last time 
around. People don't like it when their leaders squabble over how to 
hurt 
them the least. 

What would be refreshing, instead of manufactured pleasantries, would be 
for 
the Legislature to look for some real, people-friendly ways to reduce 
public 
spending over the long haul. 

The state is scheduled to spend $300 billion in the coming year on 
acquisition of sensitive lands. A good cause, but not good enough to 
take 
food, health care or protection away from our youngest and our oldest 
citizens. 

Florida TaxWatch, a respected nonpartisan watchdog group, has a number 
of 
big-ticket budget paring suggestions - 23 pages worth - that warrant 
consideration. 

TaxWatch, for instance, suggests trimming 20 percent of all university 
funding for non-instructional activities. That, it estimates, would save 
$105 million. Tax Watch also suggests assessing bad drivers a special 
license renewal surcharge similar to one in New Jersey. It would rake in 
an 
estimated $100 million a year. 

By going to an automated motor fuel tax reporting system, Tax Watch 
estimates the state would generate some $30 million a year in tax money 
now 
lost to error and evasion. 

Florida allows some of the heaviest trucks in the nation on its roads. 
They 
cause much of the $200 million in highway damage each year. TaxWatch is 
proposing the state increase penalties for overweight trucks (they 
haven't 
been raised in 50 years) and, in turn, raise another $56 million a year 
in 
tax revenues. 

Here's one that caught our eye. While most state employees pay a portion 
of 
their health insurance, legislators and their staffs, senior management 
and 
Select Exempt Service employees, Lottery workers and others - a total of 
35,000 employees - receive free health and life insurance. Free! Making 
these employees pay their fair share would save anywhere between $41 
million 
and $54 million a year. 

This is just a beginning of creative and sensible ways to save state tax 
dollars and balance budgets without hurting those most in need of the 
public's aid. The Legislature should slow down, quit bickering, be 
public 
servants instead of politicians and closely examine all of its spending. 
The 
load's getting too heavy on the kids and the old folks.

Governor Bush: 

    We have undertaken a statistical analysis of the relationship 
between FCAT scores and student economic status at every elementary and 
middle school graded by the state in 2000-01. Our study shows, in 
general, that the poorer elementary and middle schools score lower than 
their wealthier counterparts on the FCAT math and reading tests. We used 
free or reduced price lunch rates as an indicator of schools' economic 
status. 
    We would appreciate your comments. It would best if you could speak 
to us on the phone, but if that is not possible, we've included our 
questions below. We'd also be glad to explain our methodology in greater 
detail to you or an associate. 

A summary of our findings: 
 In the three years since the state implemented its accountability 
plan, the richer half of middle schools have received more than twice as 
much recognition money as the poorer schools  $30.7 million compared to 
$11.9 million. In that same time, the richer half of elementary schools 
have received $77.2 million, while the poorer half have received $40.2 
million. 
(We could not analyze high school data because the DOE does not keep 
free and reduced price lunch statistics at the high school level, where 
free lunch is not a good measure of student wealth.) 

 In 2001, "A" elementary schools had a median of 38 percent of their 
students on free and reduced price lunch, compared to 89 percent at "D" 
elementary schools. The median for all elementary schools statewide is 
58 percent. 

  For every one percent increase in the number of students on free and 
reduced price lunch at Florida middle schools, mean scores on the eighth 
grade reading FCAT drop by nearly a point. 

    Educators we have interviewed agree with you that any accountability 
program must hold every student to the same high standards. But what 
about the teachers? Is it fair to judge a teacher who works with 
disadvantaged kids by the same standards as a teacher who works with 
privileged ones? 

    Some local school officials say that the proposed new grading system 
won't affect the perennial "A" schools, whose teachers don't have to 
bring their more affluent students as far as schools with students at an 
economic and educational disadvantage. Could the accountability program 
encourage teachers to leave low-performing schools, where they must work 
much harder to get the same results from their students? 

    Certainly, all children can learn. But our study shows that many 
students from poor families are not learning at the same rate as their 
wealthier peers. How far do you expect the proposed changes to the 
accountability plan to go toward closing that gap? 

    Would you expect the proposed grading system to eliminate the gaps 
in the distribution of bonus money shown by our study between schools 
with many poor students and those with more affluent students?

Threat from Below 
Fertilizer-related nutrients and diminished water flow are threatening 
Floridas once-pristine springs. 
By John M. Dunn 

Few people know Silver Springs like Guy Marwick. After all, he and his 
buddies spearheaded the grass-roots effort to persuade state officials to 
buy 1,200 acres at the headwaters of the springs to protect it from 
development. Ten years ago, he was the prime mover in getting the Silver 
River Museum and Environmental Education Center built  a facility at the 
Silver River State Park near the springs. As the museums director, Marwick 
has guided thousands of school kids on boat trips down the crystalline 
Silver River, which flows from Silver Springs. 

Recently, several local and state lawmakers have also come aboard. What they 
see distresses them. Its hard to look at a beautiful waterway and see 
death coming, says state Rep. Nancy Argenziano of Crystal River. 

Whats tarnishing Silver Springs, Marwick tells his audiences, is an 
insidious threat creeping up from the very aquifer itself. The hazard is an 
ever-growing infusion of nitrate  a major ingredient in fertilizers  that 
keeps percolating into the porous 1,200 square miles of the Silver Springs 
Groundwater Basin. Eventually, the nitrate flushes into subterranean 
recharge waters and emerges dissolved in the mighty gush of Silver Springs  
stimulating the growth of algae and tarnishing water quality. 

A normal amount of nitrate is .02 milligrams per liter of water, explains 
senior state biologist and the states top defender of springs, Jim 
Stevenson. But once you reach 1.0, you experience ecological decline. And 
that, he adds, is the current reading at Silver Springs. The springs now 
pump out up to 820 tons of nitrate every year. 

Silver Springs isnt the only spring with the problem. A recent study 
prepared by a 16-member Florida Springs Task Force for the states 
Department of Environmental Protection reveals that most of Floridas 600 
springs now suffer from a decline in water quality thanks to nutrients 
such as nitrate. In fact, 10 of the states 33 first-magnitude springs  
those with a flow rate of at least 100 cubic feet per second  have nitrate 
levels that rival or surpass those of Silver Springs. Nitrate levels at 
Fanning Springs in nearby Levy County, for example, are over four times 
higher. 

Vulnerable to contamination 
Silver Springs international fame as Floridas oldest and longest-running 
theme park, however, gives it a higher profile. Though passengers on its 
glass-bottom boats still gaze down through what appears to be beautiful, 
clear water, the springs are unquestionably declining. 

Were losing the color of the palette of the springs, says Marwick. Much 
of the beauty of the whiteness of the sandy bottom that once glistened with 
mussel shells is now covered with algae. The eel grass also has a heavy coat 
of algae. Many aquatic plants are missing from the river that were once here 
10 years ago. 

Gone too are the mullet, striped bass, eels, channel catfish and manatees  
though their disappearance may have more to do with the presence of upstream 
Rodman Dam in Putnam County. 

Silver Springs location makes it especially vulnerable to contamination. 
For one, the regions aquifer lies close to the land surface. In addition, 
the area has a lot of sinkholes, caves and other cavities created by 
dissolved limestone that allow polluted water to seep quickly into the 
aquifer. 

Researchers calculate that the average age of the water bubbling at Silver 
Springs is about 20 years. That means some of whats coming up represents 
human abuse thats decades old. Nobody is exactly sure where todays nitrate 
comes from, but most suspect runoff from highways, farms, golf courses, 
yards and water retention ponds. 

If all this isnt bad enough, Silver Springs, like so many other springs, 
has another big problem: Its water flow is also at a 67-year record low, 
says Trudy Phelps, a hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey. Its peak 
flow was 1,200 cubic feet per second; the average is 899; but in June, it 
was 350. The ongoing drought and increased water consumption from a growing 
population are to blame. 

More troubles could be on the way. For one thing, bottled water companies 
are increasingly helping themselves to Floridas diminishing spring water. 
They can do this, says Argenziano, because they are exempt from the states 
local source first legislation, which restricts the direct removal of 
water from its source. Its time to close that loophole, she says. 

Meanwhile, many local governments in Floridas big, urban areas keep 
prowling for new water sources. Most recently, Wayne Harris, an appointee of 
Gov. Jeb Bush to the Alafia River Basin Board, stirred things up with his 
proposal to establish a statewide water conservation and distribution plan. 
Part of his plan calls for skimming off water at Silver Springs and 
transporting it through aqueducts along I-75 to storage areas created out of 
old phosphate pits. Though the idea has generated criticism, some state 
legislators are interested. 

In search of a solution 
The Florida Springs Task Force wants to protect and restore Floridas 
springs instead of tapping them. However, the group says without new funding 
to do the necessary research, monitoring, restoration and acquisition of 
water recharge basins, We wont save Floridas springs. To raise the $4.42 
million needed to get the job done, the task force recommends, among other 
things, a 25-cent increase on auto tags, a fertilizer tax and federal help. 

Floridas troubled springs have caught the attention of Bush. Last year, he 
helped push through the Florida Springs Initiative, which provides $2.5 
million meant to aid the states springs. About a third of the $92,000 
earmarked for Silver Springs will help finance an ongoing Geological Survey 
study that seeks to pinpoint the nitrate sources. But with a topography 
like the Silver Springs Groundwater Basin, it could be hard to point 
fingers, says Geological Survey hydrologist Phelps. In one respect, its 
too late to do much about the nitrate already in the aquifer anyhow. 

Even if the study does reveal the origins of nitrate sources, taking 
corrective action could prove tough. Local governments, for instance, can 
curtail the use of fertilizers on public lands, but they may have to rely on 
persuasion to reduce private use. Only one real solution exists, says 
Argenziano, who sits on the House Environmental Protection Committee. At 
some point, well have to mandate that you cant use this kind of 
fertilizer  and thats something hard to do politically. 

As bleak as the situation is, Floridians have no alternative but to try to 
save Floridas springs, says Steve Specht, spokesman for the Silver Springs 
attraction, whose owner, Jacksonville-based SmartParks, leases the site from 
the state. We cant keep going the way weve been going. If we do, well 
all be to blame, and well all pay the consequences.

I need help in getting DOT off my case and figuring out why the memorial cross which I put on the side of the highway at the location of my son's death (to a traffic accident) keeps being removed.  I understand the Party Line. There is a regulation......yadda... yadda... yadda. Yet there are scores of other locations in Central Florida where the roadside memorial are not removed.  I have replaced the little white cross 15 times along with a $30 arrangement of silk flowers and I will continue to replace the memorial and flowers.  I just don't understand why the DOT is being so vigilant in my case and totally ignoring all the others. MOST notably there are two locations where Orange county police officer have been killed. Not only is there a massive collection of flower and crosses at these locations, the Orlando Sentinel even did a story about how those memorials were part of the grief and healing process for the family and friends of the deceased.  
I have to read that, agree with everything they say and then go out in a day or two and spend more time and money trying to keep one step ahead of the DOT highway pickup crew.  It isn't fair. PERIOD.  My 18 year old son dying in a car accident wasn't fair either, but there is no one to talk to about that, it can't be undone. 
It's not like this is an eyesore or a cluttered mess. It is a simple white cross and bouquet of silk flowers.  We long ago removed all the little momento the high school kids put out and we keep it neat, so no one has reason to complain. 
SO, my question.  How do I get DOT to leave this roadside memorial alone.  It isn't hurting anyone. It doesn't look bad. And it is much smaller than most of the other similar roadside memorials in this area (which do not get removed).
 
Please help.
The location is at the intersection of SR 46 at Lake Forrest Blvd. (one mile west of I-4 on Route 46)
Thank you.

Dear Governor Bush, 

I was recently at a Restoration of Rights workshop in St. Petersburg and a 
couple of questions arose that I thought would best be answered by you. 

From the discussion, it sounded like applicants who submit their paperwork 
don't hear from the Clemency Board about a number of different items such as 
the following: if their applications have been received; if there is any 
paperwork missing; when their petitions will be heard; or if the 
applications have been refused, why they were refused. 

If this is accurate, as Governor, what is your position on the Clemency 
Board's lack of response to applicants? Are there good reasons for the lack 
of response? Is there something else that applicants need to do to receive 
status updates from the Clemency Board during the process? 

Thanks very much for your consideration. I look forward to your response. 

Happy Thanksgiving.

Subject: STO and Bobby 



Dear Governor Bush: 

Thank you for forwarding my e-mail to the appropriate persons who handle the 
Times Direct system.  I have spoken with Donna Livingston at DMS about the 
issue and hopefully they will test the system with the Bobby program to make 
it more accessible.  It may not cost a lot of money either since many of the 
changes that the Bobby Program includes are simple.  I strongly encouraged 
her to work on this problem since the state does not want to be put in a 
position of looking as though it does not care if it complies with federal 
laws.  The ADA is not a voluntary law.  I don't think the state can argue 
hardship either because it knew before the system was purchased that the 
Bobby program should be included and used to make it accessible. I don't 
know why the STO did not check this before they bought the program.  

I have a friend who works for the Department of Health and she is having the 
same problem with their statewide program used for case management.  The 
department of Health was told before they ever purchased this case 
management program that it was not accessible to the disabled however, they 
purchased it anyway. Since that department receives federal money they are 
in an awkward position because they could be sued under several different 
laws including the OFCCP and probably the DOJ. Ninety per cent of her job is 
computer work and since they have installed this new program she is unable 
to do her job because the entire program is icon based and totally 
inaccessible to blind persons who use speech programs.  It also uses a blue 
screen which makes Braille displays unusable and prevents her from using an 
Optacon which is an old device that people used to use to read displays 
before speech programs were created.  This lady, Ms. Elizabeth Bowden,  has 
worked with the Vocational Rehabilitation program for ten years and now 
because of this badly designed Department of Health Case Management system, 
she will probably have to be moved to another position through no fault of 
her own and will have to move from the job that she does very well.  She is 
a VR Technician and has handled the job well until now. By the way, the 
Comptroller's office program for Employee Earnings Statement review works 
very well and is totally accessible.   

I am letting you know these things, because  the STO is falling down on the 
job in making the state's computer systems more efficient and user friendly. 
Some of the staff  also have the attitude that its just not important and 
we've never had a blind employee before so we just didn't know.   I think it 
is very important especially when the state may be subject to being sued 
when that is not necessary if precautions  are taken. Also,not having had to 
deal with disabled employees before is not an excuse especially when there 
are programs like Bobby available to assist in making programs compliant. 

Sincerely, 

Linda Mathis

Our Opinion editorial 11/25/2001

On the backs
of the vulnerable

Gov. Jeb Bush believes he's fixed the state's budgetary woes by
convincing
enough Florida House members to postpone a $128 million reduction in the
state intangibles tax on those who own more than $20,000 worth of stocks
or
bonds.

That's good news, for sure. Divisiveness over the intangibles tax cut,
especially between House Speaker Tom Feeney and Senate President John
McKay,
turned the first special session into a knock-down, drag-out political
brouhaha, an embarrassment to the concept of public service. More
important,
what are we doing giving breaks to rich folks at a time when we must cut
essential public programs that help poor and neglected children and old
people, not to mention sick people?

So while Bush and the Legislature, which convenes for a second special
session on the budget Tuesday, may have found a balancing act that will
meet
constitutional muster by eliminating $1 billion in red ink, they should
contain any celebratory exuberance.

The fact is most of the spending cuts proposed will add up to one thing:
The
state budget, for the most part, will be balanced on the backs of those
least able to help themselves - the young, the old, the impoverished.

While Bush has been busy brokering a deal on the intangibles tax and
talking
it up, we have heard nothing about finding a way not to cut $167 million
from our public classrooms, which already get short-shrift from the
Legislature. Not a word about how to avoid cutting $66 million from a
Department of Juvenile Justice that is stretched too thin and dealing
with
Florida's fastest-growing criminal segment. What about the $7.5 million
slashed from the state's $30 million prescription drug program for poor
elderly residents or the $20 million lost in prescription drug
assistance
for the poor? No deal brokered in any of these.

With Bush up for re-election next year, look for a lovefest in
Tallahassee
this week after the Feeney-McKay public-relations debacle the last time
around. People don't like it when their leaders squabble over how to
hurt
them the least.

What would be refreshing, instead of manufactured pleasantries, would be
for
the Legislature to look for some real, people-friendly ways to reduce
public
spending over the long haul.

The state is scheduled to spend $300 billion in the coming year on
acquisition of sensitive lands. A good cause, but not good enough to
take
food, health care or protection away from our youngest and our oldest
citizens.

Florida TaxWatch, a respected nonpartisan watchdog group, has a number
of
big-ticket budget paring suggestions - 23 pages worth - that warrant
consideration.

TaxWatch, for instance, suggests trimming 20 percent of all university
funding for non-instructional activities. That, it estimates, would save
$105 million. Tax Watch also suggests assessing bad drivers a special
license renewal surcharge similar to one in New Jersey. It would rake in
an
estimated $100 million a year.

By going to an automated motor fuel tax reporting system, Tax Watch
estimates the state would generate some $30 million a year in tax money
now
lost to error and evasion.

Florida allows some of the heaviest trucks in the nation on its roads.
They
cause much of the $200 million in highway damage each year. TaxWatch is
proposing the state increase penalties for overweight trucks (they
haven't
been raised in 50 years) and, in turn, raise another $56 million a year
in
tax revenues.

Here's one that caught our eye. While most state employees pay a portion
of
their health insurance, legislators and their staffs, senior management
and
Select Exempt Service employees, Lottery workers and others - a total of
35,000 employees - receive free health and life insurance. Free! Making
these employees pay their fair share would save anywhere between $41
million
and $54 million a year.

This is just a beginning of creative and sensible ways to save state tax
dollars and balance budgets without hurting those most in need of the
public's aid. The Legislature should slow down, quit bickering, be
public
servants instead of politicians and closely examine all of its spending.
The
load's getting too heavy on the kids and the old folks.

Governor Bush: 

    We have undertaken a statistical analysis of the relationship 
between FCAT scores and student economic status at every elementary and 
middle school graded by the state in 2000-01. Our study shows, in 
general, that the poorer elementary and middle schools score lower than 
their wealthier counterparts on the FCAT math and reading tests. We used 
free or reduced price lunch rates as an indicator of schools' economic 
status. 
    We would appreciate your comments. It would best if you could speak 
to us on the phone, but if that is not possible, we've included our 
questions below. We'd also be glad to explain our methodology in greater 
detail to you or an associate. 

A summary of our findings: 
 In the three years since the state implemented its accountability 
plan, the richer half of middle schools have received more than twice as 
much recognition money as the poorer schools  $30.7 million compared to 
$11.9 million. In that same time, the richer half of elementary schools 
have received $77.2 million, while the poorer half have received $40.2 
million. 
(We could not analyze high school data because the DOE does not keep 
free and reduced price lunch statistics at the high school level, where 
free lunch is not a good measure of student wealth.) 

 In 2001, "A" elementary schools had a median of 38 percent of their 
students on free and reduced price lunch, compared to 89 percent at "D" 
elementary schools. The median for all elementary schools statewide is 
58 percent. 

  For every one percent increase in the number of students on free and 
reduced price lunch at Florida middle schools, mean scores on the eighth 
grade reading FCAT drop by nearly a point. 

    Educators we have interviewed agree with you that any accountability 
program must hold every student to the same high standards. But what 
about the teachers? Is it fair to judge a teacher who works with 
disadvantaged kids by the same standards as a teacher who works with 
privileged ones? 

    Some local school officials say that the proposed new grading system 
won't affect the perennial "A" schools, whose teachers don't have to 
bring their more affluent students as far as schools with students at an 
economic and educational disadvantage. Could the accountability program 
encourage teachers to leave low-performing schools, where they must work 
much harder to get the same results from their students? 

    Certainly, all children can learn. But our study shows that many 
students from poor families are not learning at the same rate as their 
wealthier peers. How far do you expect the proposed changes to the 
accountability plan to go toward closing that gap? 

    Would you expect the proposed grading system to eliminate the gaps 
in the distribution of bonus money shown by our study between schools 
with many poor students and those with more affluent students?

Dear Governor,
 
My biggest concern was that I had misrepresented your position. As mentioned I would understand a change because the battle being waged against us is very intense and many legislators seem to find it intimidating. Representative Carole Green called me on Friday and said, "this really is a David and Goliath fight we are in". I was so humbled and honored when Arlene called Friday to offer me the opportunity to greet the President this next Tuesday in Orlando and at the same time was so disappointed that I must be in Tallahassee for the House Committee hearing on our bill that my emotions just unloaded on her. I really appreciated the call Friday evening and your response here. My thoughts and prayers are with you during these very demanding and challenging times and your support is very appreciated. I will not let words confuse or discourage me again. I don't shy always from good, honest debate and I know that maybe not this year but in the near future with sponsors like Representative Green we will prevail. Again I am so honored that you would have given me the opportunity to greet the President and I thank you very very much.
 
Sincerely,

I really don't mean to bother you but I really would like to hear from you

This morning I learned that Lt. Governor Brogan told Senator Campbell that 
he thought you are now opposing the bill. I surely feel like I deserve a

Dear Governor, I'm sure with all the budget cuts you don't want to hear one more complaint.  I have just heard from my Vice-President off the Family Care Council who just attended the State Wide Family Care Council Chair meeting in my place in Orlando today.  She said that Carl Littlefield made the announcement there that as of January 2002 all the Pilot Projects would cease and those clients would be returned to the Home and Community Based Waiver program in their Districts.  Sir we were promised by the State of Florida that these pilot projects would continue through June 2002 , and that at that time the state would transition us into the new and improved system that will reflect the results of the pilot projects.
My major concern is that those people who will not be eligible to return to the Med-waiver program will be left high and dry with no support services at all and even those that are eligible will loose a lot of the services they currently have.
I also heard that the 6,000 that were suppose to come off the waiting list for services from Developmental Disabilities in March of 2002 was not going to happen.  Sir I thought that decision was mandated by a court order.  How can the Legislature just ignore that and do they not realize how many hundreds and thousands of people this will be placing at risk and how many will end up in institutions because of this.  Why then is all the millions of dollars being funneled into Del Marva and Maximus
when it could be put to better use helping those that need the help.  I really hate to see how many more class action law suits this is going to generate against you and the State of Florida and how much money is going to be wasted in the court battle resulting from this.

Governor.
The Wauchula brunch headed by Joe "The Democrat" Davis got the SFCC board to agree to buy his property in a residential area of Wauchula.  To me this is ridiculous.  It will throttle expansion and cause residences to complain about the number of cars and kids going and coming. They did not survey the county as to where the college should be located. 
There is another gift of property on US 17 but there seems to be some dead line on some matching funds that have caused some on the board to hurry and select site.  Why cannot the matching funds be held in abeyance for some additional time?  That would not cause them to hurry in making the site selection and maybe they would go back and rescind the vote to take Davis's site..
I have talked to William "Bill" Ammons in your office and am impressed with his concern and willingness to talk to the two members of the board that voted against the Davis site.  They are Chairman Gary Delatora, Hardee member and Joan Hartt, Highlands member.
Bill Ammons can give you a more detailed report, he talked to Gary and Joan.

We have plenty of appropriate events for him to participate in on Tuesday.   And, of course, we will come up with an event for him if he likes.   
 
I know this is a long shot, but I'm still trying.
Anything I should with him directly on this?

Dear Gov Bush:
I hear rumor that your brother is coming to Orlando next Wednesday for a tourist promotion or something like that.  This maybe false rumor, not from ABC News :).  But if he does come, it would be great if he could stop by Walt Disney World.  As you probably know this is our re-scheduled (from Sept) BIG event to promote the next 18 months for us and Florida for "Walt's 100 years of Magic!"  Wednesday is the 100th birthday of Walt...Dec 5 1901.  He really is an American original.  Anyway, is there anything I can do to make this happen?  I'm sure our folks have talked to The White House.  I'll find out tomorrow what they are saying, but tonight after going to the Laker game and a win in LA, I thought I'd write you this note.  The game was short and it's still early.

Governor Bush,
 
I am sorry that we were not able to conclude a successful meeting with Ms. McDougal. Much has transpired since our first exchange of emails. While we were in Tallahassee quite a few times, things just never materialized and schedules seemed to flee our control.
 
I am fully prepared to show you and Mr. Horne, as well as the entire education system throughout Florida, a viable way to bridge the "Digital Divide" with Wireless Internet Access, a central LMS (Learning Management System) and LCMS (Learning Content Management System) and a central communication service second to none.
 
I really believe InterSyte's UniverCT solution will provide a core foundation to build a "Revenue Stream" for the State, somewhat like the Lottery system, and fulfill the objective of One Technology for Florida's Department of Education.
 
As our favorite former speaker Newt said in a conference Wednesday at the Broward Convention Center, "... education should be available to everyone, twenty four / seven. We have the technology." 
 
I would like to propose a solution that requires very little costs up front to initialize. Then, once the program has been formalized at the executive level, the solution would be self supporting from a financial aspect early on. Translation: A solution that generates revenues, reduces existing costs, and provides for the prime objective of "quality education for all".
 
I am frustrated with the results of our approach, but my spirits and insights are higher now than ever.
 
I'm looking to you for input on how to proceed. I believe time is of the essence for all involved and will follow your advise to the best of my and InterSyte's ability.
 
Thank you for your invaluable time reading this email. My hope is to solve some of the more pressing and wide spread issues you and your colleagues have regarding these matters. We realize, it's not about promises. It's about "deliveries".
 
Sincerely

Dear Governor,
 
I'd like to discuss with you how we can leverage STATUS to further your pursuit in conquering the Digital Divide. InterSyte is one of only thirty-one contractors authorized by the U.S.-D.O.T.'s TASC, to offer eLearning and eLearning Management Systems.
 
With little to no capital outlays, we can deliver solid distance learning solutions and, in a separate program, wireless Internet connectivity. InterSyte would like to propose a solution to create revenue streams in every school building within every school district throughout the State of Florida.
 
InterSyte has solid concepts to address the following issues:
 1. Broad-based K-12 Learning Systems via distance learning technology
 2. Wireless Internet connectivity for every child, teacher and administrator in every school building.
 
Please advise on your availability to discuss via phone or in person. The CEO of InterSyte and myself will contact you at your convenience.
 
Your input is welcomed here.

The flexibility bill is supposed to be done our way--as a seperate bill and without the 1/2 mill.  Kim, Horne and Wood are all over the house and senate.

FEFP, however, is still open over the 1/2 mill.  The LG and I have been given every assurance by the house that it will go away, and the current year BSA will be reduced accordingly (this is public posturing).

Teachers liability insurance will not be cut. 

Canker was cut by $10m. 

Laptops and Pat Thomas trooper academy are both in (the academy at $500,000)...I tried to get them to choose, because the trust fund can not afford both, but Coburn told me yesterday that the fight could not be resolved and that we would get an opportunity to veto...thanks...

G Pierce Wood is still open...more public posturing. 

There is language that requires DeSoto to be expanded for SVP rather than building  a new bldg.

Dear Governor,
 
My biggest concern was that I had misrepresented your position. As mentioned I would understand a change because the battle being waged against us is very intense and many legislators seem to find it intimidating. Representative Carole Green called me on Friday and said, "this really is a David and Goliath fight we are in". I was so humbled and honored when Arlene called Friday to offer me the opportunity to greet the President this next Tuesday in Orlando and at the same time was so disappointed that I must be in Tallahassee for the House Committee hearing on our bill that my emotions just unloaded on her. I really appreciated the call Friday evening and your response here. My thoughts and prayers are with you during these very demanding and challenging times and your support is very appreciated. I will not let words confuse or discourage me again. I don't shy always from good, honest debate and I know that maybe not this year but in the near future with sponsors like Representative Green we will prevail. Again I am so honored that you would have given me the opportunity to greet the President and I thank you very very much.

Dear Governor, 
I attented the dedication of Makinson Island in Lake Toho this past friday and it was a very well attended event. I know there was a little bit of heartburn over what we had to pay, it was one of the first acquistions that I had to consider as a new commissioner. But having spent several hours on two seperate occasions rest assured that the cabinet was wise in approving the purchase. The county of Osceola, their school board and our agency will use it as a learning center for our citizens in a joint partnership that was very apparent. Hope you are doing well and will see you in Orlando next month.

Dear Governor, I'm sure with all the budget cuts you don't want to hear one more complaint.  I have just heard from my Vice-President off the Family Care Council who just attended the State Wide Family Care Council Chair meeting in my place in Orlando today.  She said that Carl Littlefield made the announcement there that as of January 2002 all the Pilot Projects would cease and those clients would be returned to the Home and Community Based Waiver program in their Districts.  Sir we were promised by the State of Florida that these pilot projects would continue through June 2002 , and that at that time the state would transition us into the new and improved system that will reflect the results of the pilot projects.
My major concern is that those people who will not be eligible to return to the Med-waiver program will be left high and dry with no support services at all and even those that are eligible will loose a lot of the services they currently have.
I also heard that the 6,000 that were suppose to come off the waiting list for services from Developmental Disabilities in March of 2002 was not going to happen.  Sir I thought that decision was mandated by a court order.  How can the Legislature just ignore that and do they not realize how many hundreds and thousands of people this will be placing at risk and how many will end up in institutions because of this.  Why then is all the millions of dollars being funneled into Del Marva and Maximus
when it could be put to better use helping those that need the help.  I really hate to see how many more class action law suits this is going to generate against you and the State of Florida and how much money is going to be wasted in the court battle resulting from this.   Your Friend Darrell Walker

Subject: Enron ... from Business Week 


ENRON: RUNNING ON EMPTY 
As the collapsed energy giant seems headed for liquidation, many losers 
count their losses 
By Peter Coy and Emily Thornton in New York and Stephanie Anderson 
Forest in Dallas, with Christopher Palmeri in Los Angeles, and bureau 
reports 

The fall of Enron-to 61 a share on Nov. 28-has already wiped out more 
than 99% of its stock-market value. Some $3.5 billion of its bonds are 
trading at just a quarter of their face value. Banks that lent billions 
to Enron will have to fight for a share in bankruptcy court. Enron's 
biggest lenders are J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup, which 
together have an estimated $1.6 billion in exposure. Of that, $900 
million is unsecured, according to sources. Other losers: Enron's 
customers, who traded everything from electricity, gas, and metals to 
telecom bandwidth, credit insurance, and weather derivatives.  In 
addition to clamoring creditors, Enron faces class actions by 
shareholders and employees, whose pensions were heavily invested in 
Enron stock. That raises questions about how much value is left in the 
company, which will probably be dismembered and sold off in parts. The 
end came quickly because Enron had overextended itself-and because 
investors and customers lost faith  in its secretive and complex 
financial maneuvers. With legions of traders working out of a Houston 
skyscraper, the company put together trades so exotic that they 
mystified many Wall Street veterans. 

Plus: SKILLING: THE MAN WHO KNEW...HOW MUCH? 
By Wendy Zellner in Dallas 

After stunning investors and employees with his abrupt resignation as 
CEO on Aug. 14, Jeffrey K. Skilling flatly denied that the announcement 
would damage the nation's largest energy trader. So much for Skilling's 
reputation as a visionary.  As bankers, investors, employees, and 
trading partners scramble to salvage what they can, it's increasingly 
hard to believe that Skilling, 48, didn't have an inkling of the 
disaster that lay ahead for the powerhouse he helped create. He 
continues to insist that he left for personal reasons: "Absolutely. 
That's the truth," he told BusinessWeek in a brief interview. And he 
won't talk about Enron's spectacular meltdown. Enron's collapse will 
only add to the pressure for Skilling to tell what he knew and when he 
knew it. There's no denying that he holds some responsibility for the 
mess. As a member of Enron's board, he supported the creation of at 
least some of the off-balance-sheet partnerships that apparently hid 
Enron's debt and allowed it to overstate profits by more than $600 
million over four years. And he, along with Chairman Kenneth L. Lay, 
approved then-CFO Andrew S. Fastow's management of some of those 
partnerships, even when other executives warned of a conflict of 
interest.

Mr. Robinson: 

    You and your staff are  public servants.  As  public servants responsible 
for prosecuting disciplinary actions involving wrongdoing by educators, you 
and your staff act on behalf of and for the protection of children who attend 
public schools.  My family is included among those who should be the 
beneficiary of the work that you and every other lawyer and staff member in 
your office have been hired to perform.  I would expect that you and your 
office staff would understand your relationship to the citizens of this 
state.  

    Obviously your staff does not understand that relationship.  As evidence 
I draw your attention to the unacceptable behavior exhibited by your staff 
during a telephone call with me this past week.  During that conversation 
your secretary, Paula, told me that she was going to put me on hold for a 
moment.  Then I heard her say "Sorry, there is a pain in the  ass woman on 
the other line." When I informed her that the "pain in the ass woman" she was 
speaking of was still on the line, she backtracked and said she had been 
talking about another woman who had made a public records request pertaining 
to FCAT.  Perhaps she was.  It really does not matter.  I am sure the "other 
woman" is also a citizen of this state who deserves the same respect and 
service as any other person seeking information from their government.  But 
that respect is apparently lacking within your department. 

    Another example of your department's disrespect for citizens expressing 
interest in your department's performance was the unacceptable language used 
by Mr. Stowers, who I understand is a lawyer in your office,  to sum up his 
opinion about my perseverance in the case involving my daughter's former 
teacher.   He stated that my perseverance in following up on that teacher's 
case has cost your department thousands of dollars and that the progress of 
the case  is "none of your damn business".  Mr. Stowers followed up on that 
comment by threatening to swear out a "harassment" complaint because of 
telephone calls that I have made in an effort to make sure that your 
department follows through on what he characterized as "just a piddly  little 
DUI case".  For the record, Mr. Stowers felt it necessary to yell during the 
majority of the conversation despite my requests that he stop yelling.  I am 
unsure if you informed Mr. Stowers of your letter to me, copied to Robin 
Safley and David Ashburn, requesting all my inquiries regarding this matter 
only go through you.  For the record, I was doing that.  Your secretary, 
Paula, asked me the day before to call back in an hour or so to find out what 
the status of the settlement agreement was.  The next day your secretary, 
Paula, directed my return call to Mr. Stowers.  I was informed by Mr. Stowers 
of the state's threat to swear out a complaint.  

    Those types of  comments are completely outrageous, unacceptable and an 
affront to me and every other citizen in this state.  I would suggest that 
you have a heart to heart talk with your staff and then issue an immediate 
apology.  You, as department head, set the tone for what you will tolerate 
with respect to staff behavior.  At this time I find your staff's behavior to 
be completely unacceptable. 

    Please govern yourself accordingly. 
    
                        Sincerely, 

                        Shannon Knox    

P.S.  If the case involving my daughter's former teacher's is, in fact, "just 
a piddly little DUI", why will it have taken over a year to reach the 
settlement?

Realizing you must be inundated with e-mail, I wanted to make sure you 
received the following, since I had not heard back from you... 


Gov. Bush: 

I wanted to make you aware of an opportunity as well as followup on a brief 
discussion we had back in late September, prior to the Florida Tourism 
Commission meeting at Amelia Island. 

First the opportunity. 

More than 500 volunteers, in the Florida Keys, recently completed the bulk of 
construction on a new two-acre playground in Marathon. Most of the park and 
its play accessories were concepted by elementary school kids, with final 
design and engineering plans completed and supervised by a professional 
playground design firm. The new facility is to be dedicated before Christmas 
and given the nature of this project, I thought you might wish to preside 
over the ceremony. The date is somewhat flexible, so perhaps it can be 
considered by you and your schedulers. The park's location is quite close to 
Florida Keys Marathon Airport, making transportation  simple. Perhaps you or 
a staff member might let me know if this can be considered. 

Next, the followup. 

Prior to the Florida Tourism Commission meeting, we chatted about the need 
for a Florida Keys tourism representative to serve on the Florida Tourism 
Commission. The Keys has no representation on the board and given the role

Subject:	Professional Practices Services & a Brevard case


  Dear Jeb and Frank, 

      I know you fellows are busy tending to many issues and it has been a tough haul having to initiate special sessions over the state budget shortfall. You have my sympathy, considering this all this hullabaloo is taking place just before the 2002 election. Ugh. 
       Anyway, I just have to address a situation taking place with the PPS which involves an investigation of a Brevard teacher, Sharon Busshaus. My daughters attend the school where this teacher is employed. I have to tell you guys, this teacher's reputation for drinking on the job is well known in the community. 
       I spoke to Jim Horne at the ELC conference for several minutes about this case, and he appeared to be aware and concerned about the investigation. I shared that I had been told that Mr. Robinson, General Counsel for PPS had actually referenced an email I'd sent to Charlie Crist some weeks ago where I stated that this "case" should NOT be considered a parent's "personal vendetta" against a teacher. However, in a response to Mrs. Knox, he used the term "personal vendetta", mentioned MY email, which I believe was absolutely unnecessary. Mrs. Knox has  taken it upon herself to bring a BAD situation to the forefront so it could be addressed. There are several parents concerned about the unprofessional conduct of this teacher over the years. This is much MORE than a DUI situation. Let me explain. 
      This past Thursday I picked up my daughter Arielle and on the way to her piano lesson she asked to stop at Kentucky Fried Chicken for something to eat. While there, a very "chatty" teenager was sweeping the floor and asked Arielle if she liked the popcorn chicken. She replied "yes", but that it was spicey. I asked the girl if she attended Satellite High School, the high school which my daughter's middle school "feeds". She said yes, that she was in 10th grade. She then asked my daughter if she attends DeLaura Middle School. My daughter said "yes." She asked who some of her teachers were. Arielle named a few. The girl said "Do you have Busshaus?" Arielle said know. Not wanting to act as though I was familiar with this teacher, I asked her why she asked. The girls replied, and I quote "Well, she's a drunk...we used to talk about the "clear coffee" she used to drink." She then told me how the teacher would stumble around the room, had fallen down a couple of times and also that Ms. Busshaus would doze off during class. 
      I realize that since this student, the KFC employee, Margaret, is in 10th grade, that this had to have taken place 3 years ago. But it distresses me knowing that this teacher has a file that is considerably thick, with letters from parents...yet the administration chooses to give the teacher good evaluations, year after year. It does seem to amount to dishonesty on their part. It bothers me that students, for several years have had to observe the alcoholic behavior of this teacher. 
      Let me go back a little further. 
      A former band parent president from Satellite HS, Pat Connelly, who is a friend of mine....when I called her earlier this school year to see if any of her three children had been taught by Ms. Busshaus, she said yes, that her son (now at FSU) had her. When I asked what he/she thought of this teacher her words were, "she's a drunk." Now I have to ask, why has this sorry situation not been addressed by the district the last several years?  Are the school administrators afraid to contend with the teacher's union who continually protect teachers who fail to educate children? 
       Please know that I am sympathetic to alcoholics being familiar with the disease. My mother was afflicted and my own childhood was impaired. Yet I also have great compassion for hundreds of kids who have had to observe this teacher's hangovers, her emotional outbursts (I am told that she cries in class) and loss of instruction over the years. 
       I am deeply concerned about the way Mrs. Knox is being treated by the staff and counsel at PPS. There really is no excuse to treat a concerned parent with hostility and ridicule using legalese. Mrs. Knox is married to an attorney and neither of them are impressed with the manner in which their inquiries are being handled. 
       As President of IVBE, whose membership continues to grow, I have great interest in how parents are being served statewide. I have to say that I am disappointed in PPS right now, because I have always believed that the State of Florida employees have better manners than local personnel at our school districts. 
       Should I go out personally into the community of Satellite Beach and round up a few former students of Ms. Busshaus to provide some personal, real-life statements regarding their experiences in this teacher's classroom? I say this because this investigation has overlooked the very individuals who are have been impacted- the students who were assigned to her classes. 
       When I spoke to Jim Horne in Atlanta, he seemed concerend about Mr. Robinson's demeanor over this case, and I assumed he'd be addressing the situation when he returned. I wish someone would look into this matter because several employees, including a Mr. Stowers, are doing a very POOR job of representing the PPS for the Florida Dept of Education. When a state employee threatens a parent with a harassment complaint, I'd say that something is very out of whack, wouldn't you? 
        Is this how the "state" deals with parents they find to be a nuisance? Or is this how a few unprofessional employees decide to "personalize" a situation because they have not been trained well enough in dealing with a public that has been asked to require "accountability" from the education system? 
        Anyway, please look into this situation if you would, okay? We will need every vote we can get for the Bush/Brogan team and situations like this make our Republican administration appear as hostile to the public it serves. 
        Thanks fellows. 
         Your friend, 
                Shelley

Subject: Wackenhut award of SVP project (George Zoley)



Dear Governor Bush:

I regret to inform you of my extreme frustration and need of your help regarding the Sexually Violent Predator (SVP) program for Florida.

Wackenhut subsidiary Atlantic Shores Healthcare (ASH) has been for some time trying to accomplish two objectives:

1.  Persuade DCF to confirm our selection by the Correctional Privatization Commission (CPC)as the winner of the SVP procurement (due to having received the highest number of points) and begin the negotiations allowing us the opportunity to propose a new permanent SVP facility that is cost-effective for the state of Florida.

*	DCF staff argue that because you previously vetoed $10,000 in SVP funds for CPC, you effectively removed any legal authority for continuing the SVP RFP process; 

*	Further, DCF staff assert that you are now opposed to a new facility because of cost issues - before allowing us an opportunity to negotiate a cost-effective solution that would fulfill an important need, create hundreds of construction jobs, and be funded through bond financing. 

*	We have spent one year competing on the SVP RFP (still authorized pursuant to last year's legislation), incurred over $500,000 in expenses in-house and with builders/architects, received the highest number of points among all competitors, and were selected by the CPC for contract award; 

*	We need your help, and/or the legislature, to direct DCF to begin the negotiation process subject to achieving a cost-effective solution for the state.

2.  Persuade DCF to allow us to take over the emergency SVP contract/program in Desoto County, given that we have won the competition for the development and operation of the permanent SVP contract/program.

*	The existing emergency SVP contract/program in Desoto County is operated by an out-of-state company who received the contract without competition under a 30-day cancellation provision; 

*	DCF staff assert that they would like to re-bid the existing emergency SVP operations-only contract; 

*	We hope that you can persuade DCF to allow our Florida company, who won the competition for the permanent SVP contract/program in Desoto County involving the same sexual offenders (including facility operations and development) to assume the emergency contract over a 60 to 90 day period with a cost reduction to the state; 

*	We are deeply disturbed over so much preference being given to an out-of-state company when our Florida company won the competitive bid and is fully capable of delivering professional services with a cost savings to the state.

I would appreciate a meeting with you on this subject, or you can reach me on my cell phone number (954) 253 7634.

Sincerely,

George C Zoley, Chairman - Atlantic Shores Healthcare (a Wackenhut subsidiary)

Governor Jeb,
 
We had talked about the Time Management Seminar, the value of 1 1/2 to 2 hours per day gained.  Jay Lowe and I, who are big supporters of your, want to GIVE YOU THIS.  We Will Give you a Free SEMINAR, for whomever you would like, your leaders, a department, whatever group or groups you would like, with no commitment or expense on your part.
February 18th, on Monday, we are giving one to over 150 teachers, and many ministers, (The church version).  February 19th or 20th, the city of Tallahassee is getting their second one, which they requested right after the first one two weeks ago.  Since Jay is going to be here, and we have a TV station booked, we will give one for up to fifty leaders, department heads, whomever you desire, FREE.
The workbooks, everything is on us.  Then, after you receive the feedback, and the budget is set for 2002, you might, (again, no obligation or hassle) want to have some more set up for the state.
Either the 19th or 20th, of February, morning or afternoon, (they are four hours).  Let us know the date and we will contribute this as an act towards helping you be re-elected.  
The other party is trying to destroy and tear down what you have wisely been building. This small part, might lead to a much larger contribution to stream-lining the state and letting Florida be a national model.  Again, no obligation after this one.
Looking forward to hearing from you.
I will cc this to Tom and Paul Mitchell as well if you like.
Thanks Governor, keep up the fabulous work.
Most Sincerely,  
Jeff  E. Griggs
Executive Vice-President
Jay Lowe Seminars.

Hi Governor,
 
Last week, I attended and was honored to be a part of Broward County's celebration of being a "Community of Excellence".  I heard Dr. John O. Agwunobi talk and was so pleased a Pediatrician stands so high in the Department of Health in Florida.
 
We all have truly entered another era, one of greater fiscal responsibility and accountability. Attached are two letters I have sent to support my children with disabilities, and children like them, in community programs.  Much of my children's services are school based and I have needed to spend enormous amounts of time advocating for them.
 
I appreciate your efforts and funding of programs for children with disabilities.  I urge you to remember many of them can truly become independent and productive in society with appropriate supports and programs given early for skill, self-esteem, and social development.
 
Thank you and enjoy the weekend.

Greetings again,

Following is a letter our condo associations sent to get help requarding our dangerous beach erosion.  We need your assistance in helping us get emergency permits to save our 13 story building from falling into the ocean.  We can not wait for another storm.  It would not be wise or responsible to act carelessly by putting this off as we have more residents and lives that will be effected by this.  Why are they treating us in such an irresponsible way.  If they had only done something sooner we would be able to better secure our building.

We are desperate for your help.  I sense you know God and I pray He is able to use you in this urgent need.  We cannot wait for elderly people to be floating out to sea in the middle of the night.  We can't afford to act after the fact like we did with airport security.  It always cost more to act in a crisis.

We need your help today.  I will be meeting with different TV stations that want to cover this story.  I would love to tell them that we have local, state and goverment leaders that act swiftly and responsibly.  Can we count on you? Blessings.

Dear Sir:  Received a bid of $180,000.00 to complete our seawall.  One-half of that cost is to move the 92 feet currently installed approximately 10 feet closer to my house.  The price has tripled in the 5 years I have been embroiled in this debate, and the condition of the beach continues to deteriorate.  The stand of those opposed to letting me finish my wall in its as-built location is that they will gain habitat if I am forced to move the wall.  This is not true, the erosion is too aggressive.  In 1996 the coastal engineer for Indian River County, made an official statement that beaches in Sector 7 will lose 6 to 8 feet per year, NO STORM EVENTS!  Someone needs to look at all the science & information as a whole and not select only the information that serves their purpose.  It isn't fair to you, or to those effected by the resulting decisions.  I am asking again for your assistance.  Look forward to seeing you at the Beckers, December 14th.  Cheryl Gerstner

So the Republican Party in Orlando is distributing many tickets now to your brother's appearance on Tuesday at the convention center, and we are writing about it.

So for tonight's story: What can your brother coming to Orlando do for Florida's sagging tourism? welcome shot in the arm at a time of need?

Subject:	mentoring - time sensative - Legislative request

Governor - 

Spent much of this morning trying to rescue mentoring funds in the 
legislature.  A quick recap: 

First Special Session:  Our biggest hold out has been Rep. Lynn - despite the 
stalwart and vocal support of her committee members.  We then were prepared 
to run an amendment on the floor - and had LaCasa's assistance - to limit the 
mentoring cuts to 20%.  This would have been amendment #4 prior to the House 
ending the Special Session early. 

Second Special Session:  Thursday the House passed a floor amendment which 
brought the mentoring programs up to 100%!  Our mentoring group includes: 
Gov's Mentoring Initiative, Take Stock, Big Brothers and Boys and Girls Clubs 
- for the most part these are run together in one package.  

Yesterday, the House sent this to the Senate which came back with an offer to 
allow the mentoring groups to keep 95% of last year's base but cut all new 
funding.  This morning I talked with Cheryl of Feeney's staff (Feeney was in 
the air on way to Tallahassee) and she went down to talk with Rep. Lynn for 
me.  Apparently, and I did not know this, Fasano had just been in and asked 
Lynn the same thing.  Cheryl said Lynn was a bit put out (feeling not in 
charge, I believe) but asked her to bump it up to Feeney.  Cheryl said a call 
from the Lt. Gov to Feeney should solidify it, but I talked with Hayden who 
told me the LG might not be seeing Feeney before 12:00 tomorrow, but that you 
were playing golf with him and might discuss it. 

Cheryl also talked with LaCasa who is supportive - had the eternal question 
of where the money would come from - but is (and has been) willing to 
support. 

Although you and I talked about a 5% cut to mentoring, I know our group is 
willing to take up to a 20% off the total for each program.  I talked with 
Kim McDougall and she suggested perhaps we ask Feeney for 10%.  The critical 
thing is that the legislature expanded these programs to go to more areas 
(Big Brothers) or statewide (Take Stock) with the last legislative session so 
we would not only have to fire all the new hires, but cut into the base to 
make up the difference for what was spent the first half of the year. 

I cannot seem to access my work email from home today, so if you would 
respond to this personal account, I would appreciate it.  Because of the time 
sensitivity, if I do not hear back from you by 5:00, I will call to ensure 
you have this information. 

Thank you!  Liza  



(Governor Mentoring Initiative funds  we use to incentivize League of Cities, 
military, provide training for the school districts, provide coordinators in 
rurual areas of the state and more.)

Subject:	Gertner Seawall

Dear Sir:  Received a bid of $180,000.00 to complete our seawall.  One-half of that cost is to move the 92 feet currently installed approximately 10 feet closer to my house.  The price has tripled in the 5 years I have been embroiled in this debate, and the condition of the beach continues to deteriorate.  The stand of those opposed to letting me finish my wall in its as-built location is that they will gain habitat if I am forced to move the wall.  This is not true, the erosion is too aggressive.  In 1996 the coastal engineer for Indian River County, made an official statement that beaches in Sector 7 will lose 6 to 8 feet per year, NO STORM EVENTS!  Someone needs to look at all the science & information as a whole and not select only the information that serves their purpose.  It isn't fair to you, or to those effected by the resulting decisions.  I am asking again for your assistance.  Look forward to seeing you at the Beckers, December 14th.  Cheryl Gerstner

She also has exceptional organizational skills, balancing the roles of wife, mother, career woman, and Ph.D. candidate. She is a straight shooter whose yes means yes.  If one knows Lynette, one likes Lynette. I know that she would be a credit to the superlative management team you have assembled.  She would serve you well as Secretary of Elder Affairs.

Dear Gov. Bush:  Since January of 1997, I have been trying to complete my seawall needed to protect what is left of my oceanfront property & my home in Indian River Bounty.  I have been in communication with you on this matter since February 2000.  As you may recall, this 5 year controversy is over the position of the DEP that the wall is 15 feet too far seaward, and therfore represents a "take" of turtle habitat.  We have through your efforts, those of local officials, and our own been given a permit to move the wall as few as 8 feet.  We continue to request that we be allowed to complete the wall in its as-built location for several reasons.  The primary reason is the expense.  At $850 a foot, it would cost $78,200 to move this wall even 1 foot.  Some quotes are as high as $1000.00 a foot.  We have also resisted moving the wall for reasons of value to our primary asset, because we have documented the inconsistencies regarding the placement of permitted wals elsewhere, and because we know that moving our wall is not going to make a significant difference.  The scuttlebut is that the unwillingness of the decision makers to reach the obvious conclusion regarding the "Gerstner Wall" is their fear of setting a precendent.  It is not this decision that willset a precendent; the inconsistent application of the rules and regs has already established that "opening".  What hasn't yet happened is a court case to expose those Inconsistencies.  Noone wants to be the one to take on that task, and is it really necessary?  Chairwoman Ginn if in Tallahassee today and may contact you to make this same appeal.  I know there are agencies that could not tolerate a $100,000 budget cut.  Please consider what it represents to me and my family and weigh that cost against the gain.  You are acutely aware of the critical condition of our beaches.  Seawalls are only temporary structures that buy time until the conditions dictating their need can be cured.  We need sand by-pass srojects at inlets & nourishing programs.  I would not contact you again if I did not think it was going to take your influence to get this done.  Thank you, Cheryl Gerstner

Hello Laura & Frank:  

        I know that you guys have a lot to deal with right now, however, it is 
because of the impact the legislative process will have on all agencies, 
that I felt it is important that I communicate with you that I am indeed 
ready to be a part of the leadership team addressing the issues that will 
affect our State as a whole, and particularly the Department of Elder Affairs. 
  
         My peripheral view of the legislative process propels me to want to 
further communicate our need for a "qualified" individual, who shares and 
supports the Governor's vision to serve as Secretary of Elder Affairs.  In 
light of the economic challenges facing our State and the budget the 
governor and legislature is crafting to accommodate the shortfall, it is 
critical to have a team that will work cohesively to carry forth the 
Governor's priorities.  I am committed to doing that. There is not doubt, 
that I have a solid formal educational foundation (accounting, business 
administration, communication, human resources development, organization 
development, planning, etc.) and work experiences that encompass both the 
legislative and administrative processes in government.  I am no stranger to 
public and private sector partnerships/initiatives that seek to balance 
interests of businesses and community organizations and members. 

        I think the tenants of Florida's Golden Choices would serve as an 
excellent framework for prioritizing the allocation of resources, program 
development and implementation within the provisions of the new budget.  
I firmly believe that it is important to have input from citizens whose 
benefit our services are intended.  It is going to be more important now 
than ever before to serve as a catalyst to help citizens make informed 
decisions and develop solutions to their problems or needs by providing 
access to information and services with the least red tape.  I would seek to 
include this as a hallmark in our service delivery strategies.  Re-framing 
the roles and perceptions about the roles of our elderly would be 
effectuated by preserving ties between community (institutions, businesses, 
schools and youth) and our elderly citizens. I realize that our elderly 
provide a vast reservoir of abilities and experiences of great benefit to 
our State.  I would encourage those actions that would cultivate them in our 
initiatives. 

        Lastly, providing choices in selecting the appropriate level of care 
for our frail and ill will stimulate competition and ultimately, offer 
quality options for our elderly and their families.  Supporting our elderly 
to age with dignity in terms they identify, maintain their independence to 
the maximum point feasible, in an environment that is safe from abuse, 
neglect and other crimes would be the underpinnings of initiatives that I 
would favor and eagerly pursue. 

        Let me again, affirm my belief and dedication to this administration and 
request your willingness to work with me.  Armed with the shared view of 
Governor's vision and mission, I believe we will work well together to serve 
our citizens, building on the existing efforts and making refinements at the 
right time for the right reasons. 

        As Secretary of Elder Affairs -- a team player, I will diligently 
seek to effectively balance the interests of the myriad of stakeholders 
(i.e. elders, legislators, area agencies, and federal agencies/grantors) 
through proper planning and open communications every step of the way.  I 
don't know all the challenges we will face, however, I do know that working 
together we can achieve great things for our State and its elderly citizens. 

        Again, I am asking for the opportunity and I am hopeful that I will 
be appointed Secretary of Elder Affairs.  Again, thanks for meeting with me.

Subject: Gerstner Seawall: Indian River County


Dear Gov. Bush:  Since January of 1997, I have been trying to complete my seawall needed to protect what is left of my oceanfront property & my home in Indian River Bounty.  I have been in communication with you on this matter since February 2000.  As you may recall, this 5 year controversy is over the position of the DEP that the wall is 15 feet too far seaward, and therfore represents a "take" of turtle habitat.  We have through your efforts, those of local officials, and our own been given a permit to move the wall as few as 8 feet.  We continue to request that we be allowed to complete the wall in its as-built location for several reasons.  The primary reason is the expense.  At $850 a foot, it would cost $78,200 to move this wall even 1 foot.  Some quotes are as high as $1000.00 a foot.  We have also resisted moving the wall for reasons of value to our primary asset, because we have documented the inconsistencies regarding the placement of permitted wals elsewhere, and because we know that moving our wall is not going to make a significant difference.  The scuttlebut is that the unwillingness of the decision makers to reach the obvious conclusion regarding the "Gerstner Wall" is their fear of setting a precendent.  It is not this decision that willset a precendent; the inconsistent application of the rules and regs has already established that "opening".  What hasn't yet happened is a court case to expose those Inconsistencies.  Noone wants to be the one to take on that task, and is it really necessary?  Chairwoman Ginn if in Tallahassee today and may contact you to make this same appeal.  I know there are agencies that could not tolerate a $100,000 budget cut.  Please consider what it represents to me and my family and weigh that cost against the gain.  You are acutely aware of the critical condition of our beaches.  Seawalls are only temporary structures that buy time until the conditions dictating their need can be cured.  We need sand by-pass srojects at inlets & nourishing programs.  I would not contact you again if I did not think it was going to take your influence to get this done.  Thank you, Cheryl Gerstner

Dear Governor: 

I understand and can appreciate your concern. This tragedy has changed our 
country forever. The good thing that has come out of all this is, we as a 
people are closer than we have been in a long time. Thank you for getting 
back to me so quickly. I know this week is a busy one. Also, I am feeling 
better, thanks. 

I will keep you updated as to the airing of the show and I would like to meet 
with you about the outreach component for the community. As I told you in our 
April meeting, we would like to get the program on ITV, because it is a great 
education tool for  teachers to use in explaining different disabilities to 
regular education students.  I will be in Tallahassee on January 22 and 23 
and if your schedule permits maybe we could meet to discuss it. 

We are also having our annual Autism Awareness Day on January 23, 2002, and 
Carraba's Italian Grill will be providing lunch on the Capitol grounds.  I 
would like to personally invite you to attend the lunch. Chicken Marsala will 
served be from 11:30 AM - 1:00 PM. Please let me know if your schedule 
permits. There will be displays and information from CARD (Centers for Autism 
& Related Disabilities), The Autism Society of Florida, Unlocking Autism and 
more. We are expecting many parents from around the state that have children 
with Autism Spectrum Disorder. I know the families would be honored if you 
could attend.

Dear Jeb,  I am concerned about the practice of issuing drivers licenses to 
people with Visas that are about to expire.  Yesterday I was in the Drivers 
License Bureau and observed many people with Visa's that expire this month  
yet still given a Florida License that is good for four years.  About 30 
percent of the people coming into this office were from other countries.  If 
the Visas are expiring within a week or two, why is Florida issuing a license 
to drive?  Thank you for your attention to this concern.

Dear Mr. Green:
Im writing you regarding Permit Application 66769. I understand this permit gives Dueren & Davis, L.L.C. of Winter Garden an allocation of millions of gallons of water per day for the year 2002. Not to mention further allocations of water in the years to follow. Water that is desperately needed in this area, water that would further endanger the chain of lakes.
 
With the enormous shortage of water in this area, how do we justify more water for golf courses? I understand that we need growth in this area. However, I wonder if anyone is taking a look at the environmental damage that we are doing to the chain of lakes in Clermont. How many more golf courses do we need? Between water being diverted at Polk County, new development sprouting up at every corner and more golf courses...how long before there is not enough water to even drink!
 
These decisions made by the water management district will impact the whole community. As a small business owner, I can tell you our business is almost bankrupt because all the lake ramps are now closed and people cant boat. Not to mention the value of lake front property has dropped and continues to drop. Please, do not tell me this is because of a drought! While I may agree we have not had substantial rainfall lately, we all know water is 
 
-2-
being diverted out of this area and no one person or agency has wanted to deal with this in an open and fair manner. We also know the city is growing at an alarming rate and all those new homes consume water. However, allocating more water for more golf courses is a travesty! How do we justify this?
 
I hope you reconsider this permit. Please take a moment to think this over and perhaps even do another environmental impact study. Im sure you will find the damage done to the lakes could be stopped if not reversed with a little planning. Ive heard several impact studies have been done. However, Ive heard nothing about what the results of these studies have demonstrated. I would like to see the water management district and local governments begin to work together on some of these critical water issues. I do understand your job is not to put limits on growth. However, it is your job to keep our lakes striving and protect our natural resources. Siphoning water out of Cherry Lake will be the disaster for this chain of lakes and our community.
 
Thank you very much for your attention. If you have any questions, please contact me at 352-242-5166. Im sending a copy of this letter to the governors office in hopes that perhaps some other agencies may be willing to help with this issue.
 
 
 
Bright Blessings,

Governor, 

I am writing to let you know this matter has now been resolved.  

The Building Code Administrators and Inspectors Board met by telephone 
conference this morning to consider Mr. Lee Wansor's application to be a 
building code administrator.  After reviewing the new materials submitted by 
Mr. Wansor and speaking with him about his supervisory experience, the Board 
voted unanimously to approve his application. 

As always, if we may be of additional assistance, please do not hesitate to 
have someone from your office contact me.

Governor, 

Secretary Binkley-Seyer is out of town and has asked that I respond directly 
to you to avoid any further delay. 

Mr. Lee Wansor writes regarding what he believes is a questionable practice 
by the Board of Building Code Administrators and Inspectors.  Upon review, 
the Department finds he has a point bearing further inquiry. 

While we do not have records available to speak to events transpiring in 
1993, we are aware of the circumstances behind the recent denial of Mr. 
Wansor's application to be a Building Code Administrator.  Specifically, Mr. 
Wansor's application was denied for two reasons: (1) lack of experience; and 
(2) an insufficient affidavit verifying work experience. 

First, Mr. Wansor represents that he has 18 years of relevant experience 
where 10 years are required by statute.   The relevant statute also requires 
five (5) years of supervisory experience.  The Board considered Mr. Wansor's 
application and determined he lacked the necessary experience by unanimous 
vote.  His application, however, reveals that he may have the necessary 
experience. 

Second, Mr. Wansor was required to submit an affidavit verifying his work 
experience.  A certain type of building professional must sign the 
affidavit.  Unfortunately, a proper party did not sign Mr. Wansor's 
affidavit.  This procedural defect can be easily remedied. 

The order of intent to deny Mr. Wansor's application was sent out on 
November 6, 2001.  The order informs Mr. Wansor of his right to have a 
hearing and bring this matter to the Board's attention once again. 

We are writing Mr. Wansor directly to inform him of his rights and the above 
issues regarding his application.  We also will be having a meeting shortly 
between Board counsel, the Board's Executive Director, and myself to revise 
the Board's application review procedures.  We specifically intend to 
explore whether Board counsel may be more fully incorporated into the 
application review process.  We believe this would allow ambiguous 
qualifications to be resolved one way or the other prior to the issuance of 
a denial order. 

Our correspondence to Mr. Wansor will follow immediately and we will be sure 
to copy you. 

Hardy Roberts 
General Counsel, DBPR

 I hope I'm not to late to apply for the Board of Med.  I keep planning to fill out my form and will get to it some time tonight.  I just have to type it.  I'm just been swamped with new clinics and activities. 

Hope you'll consider my app for the consumer position for the Board of Med.

Nothing yet from Tara on a possible meeting with you next Tuesday (or 
whenever...)...I'll call you all. 

Another issue:  Some time ago we invited you to be present at the Everglades 
Coalition meeting, as our guest, to open the conference on Thursday night 
(it's a legacy!).  As an added bonus, there is the possibility that the 
"RECOVER" Memorandum of Understanding (regarding the performance goals of 
Everglades Restoration) may be signed that night.  This, of course, would 
get great coverage and be a terrific opportunity to highlight your 
leadership on this issue, as well as to underline the progress to date (and 
funding?). 

That would be Thursday, 3 January, sometime around 6-7:30 PM, at the Ft. 
Lauderdale Marina Marriott.

Subject:	Hi!

Dear Governor Bush: 
Hope all is well in your world at this time.  Things have to be pretty busy for you; however, I hope you do get some time for Christmas fun this month!!!! 

I was at a tree trimming party last night....if you go to one, Hershey has an ornament full of kisses that was the hit of the party--we were an easily entertained group....and met a couple of public school teachers.  Very nice ladies that took their jobs VERY seriously. 

Ever since I met you in Orange Park while running for Governor and you told me how the way the children are taught in the schools had changed so drastically since we were in school...and may I mention it wasn't ALL THAT LONG AGO (hahahaha)...it has bothered me.  Well, to make a short story long, here is our conversation you will definitely find interesting: 

The teacher I met is Kimberly Dennis of John Love Elementary in Jacksonville, Florida.  This school is about 1/2 mile from Alltel Stadium.  I asked Kimberly if she had the choice to have anyone in the State involved with the school who would she want...she said the parents!  Then I asked her who did she think, in the State, if she could get anyone involved, could motivate the parents to get involved, her first and quick answer was BUSH.  I asked her why.  Kimberley gave me the example that if she asks the parents to send a poster to school, they don't comply.  But, when the Principal requests the same thing, they respond.  Then I asked, "OK, if you could get Bush what environment would the parents attend and be most motivated in, the school?  a church?"  She said the school, a neutral place.  I asked her if the Mayor would have the same impact, and she didn't seem to think the impact would be as great as if you were there.   

Jeb, this is a teacher from an inner city school who truly cares about her students.  Perhaps if you are in area at some point you would be able to help Kimberley motivate the parents.  Her e-mail address is denniskimberly@hotmail.com.  I assure you that at the point Kimberley made these statements, she did not know that I am a Bush supporter, nor that we had worked together on Nursing home issues.  I did tell her after this conversation of my involvement within the system (no specifics) regarding Nursing homes.  Let me know your thoughts... 

I hope you don't mind my forwarding these type of ideas to you.  It looks, too, like a great way for you to get exposure in downtown Jax, an area that is heavily democrats.  Knowing you, though, you wouldn't need an election to consider this type of event!!!!   

All right, well that's enough cheerleading....I continue to support our economy, and am off to Christmas shop again....HAVE A GREAT WEEK!!!!

Hi Governor,
 
Last week, I attended and was honored to be a part of Broward County's celebration of being a "Community of Excellence".  I heard Dr. John O. Agwunobi talk and was so pleased a Pediatrician stands so high in the Department of Health in Florida.
 
We all have truly entered another era, one of greater fiscal responsibility and accountability. Attached are two letters I have sent to support my children with disabilities, and children like them, in community programs.  Much of my children's services are school based and I have needed to spend enormous amounts of time advocating for them.
 
I appreciate your efforts and funding of programs for children with disabilities.  I urge you to remember many of them can truly become independent and productive in society with appropriate supports and programs given early for skill, self-esteem, and social development.
 
Thank you and enjoy the weekend.

Subject:	Wackenhut award of SVP project (George Zoley)

Dear Governor Bush:

I regret to inform you of my extreme frustration and need of your help regarding the Sexually Violent Predator (SVP) program for Florida.

Wackenhut subsidiary Atlantic Shores Healthcare (ASH) has been for some time trying to accomplish two objectives:

1.  Persuade DCF to confirm our selection by the Correctional Privatization Commission (CPC)as the winner of the SVP procurement (due to having received the highest number of points) and begin the negotiations allowing us the opportunity to propose a new permanent SVP facility that is cost-effective for the state of Florida.

*	DCF staff argue that because you previously vetoed $10,000 in SVP funds for CPC, you effectively removed any legal authority for continuing the SVP RFP process;
*	Further, DCF staff assert that you are now opposed to a new facility because of cost issues - before allowing us an opportunity to negotiate a cost-effective solution that would fulfill an important need, create hundreds of construction jobs, and be funded through bond financing.
*	We have spent one year competing on the SVP RFP (still authorized pursuant to last year's legislation), incurred over $500,000 in expenses in-house and with builders/architects, received the highest number of points among all competitors, and were selected by the CPC for contract award;
*	We need your help, and/or the legislature, to direct DCF to begin the negotiation process subject to achieving a cost-effective solution for the state.

2.  Persuade DCF to allow us to take over the emergency SVP contract/program in Desoto County, given that we have won the competition for the development and operation of the permanent SVP contract/program.

*	The existing emergency SVP contract/program in Desoto County is operated by an out-of-state company who received the contract without competition under a 30-day cancellation provision;
*	DCF staff assert that they would like to re-bid the existing emergency SVP operations-only contract;
*	We hope that you can persuade DCF to allow our Florida company, who won the competition for the permanent SVP contract/program in Desoto County involving the same sexual offenders (including facility operations and development) to assume the emergency contract over a 60 to 90 day period with a cost reduction to the state;
*	We are deeply disturbed over so much preference being given to an out-of-state company when our Florida company won the competitive bid and is fully capable of delivering professional services with a cost savings to the state.

I would appreciate a meeting with you on this subject, or you can reach me on my cell phone number (954) 253 7634.

Sincerely,

George C Zoley, Chairman - Atlantic Shores Healthcare (a Wackenhut subsidiary)

It is dangerously close to Christmas.  I have come to hate Holidays from years and years of seeing the same-ol, same ol's getting and the same ol's not. Somehow, the system never seems to remember the disabled at Holidays except to put some of us caregivers through "The Grinch That Stole  Funds" spirits! 

It is very hard for some to buy Christmas EVEN IF they have the money.  Ever tried to shop with your disabled child at Christmas in the Mall?  Then - try to convince them that the big fat man in the red suit shoved it down your non-existant chimney? Ever noticed all the displays right in the middle of the aisles?  We do, we drag them on the back or side of the wheelchair. But, PCA is not for the Mom to "run errands".  Just tag along the child with you, even for that ob/gyn  exam. Cold and flu season falls at Christmas.  If you take them out and they get sick - it pallors the gifts under the tree.And - over the counter is general utility and will not be covered. 

So, in the spirit of Christmas a comin', I am giving free lessons and exercises to anyone that decides on funds for the disabled, makes decisions for the disabled, etc. that does not take care of the disabled.... kind of a "walk in our AFO'S".....read on and Merry Christmas! 

Exercise One: 
Purchase one mesh net bag with holes in it 
Catch one very large, peed-off, live octopus 
Place octopus in bag, make sure all tentacles are inside the bag and not injured in any way 
Everytime the octopus gets the bag wet (immediately and quite often), repeat the above steps 
Lesson Learned:  How to dress the disabled and why more than three incontinent briefs a day really is not excessive 

Exercise Two: 
Get one large bleach bottle and one large tablespoon and one piece of rope and a hook 
Cut a whole in the front of the bottle smaller than a teaspoon 
Hang the bottle from the rope and put the rope on the hook suspended from the ceiling 
Start swinging the bottle 
Each time the bottle swings toward you, place the teaspoon full of something very messy into the hole you cut out, make sure the bottle keeps moving 
Lesson Learned:  How to orally feed the disabled and why housekeeping service was thought of in the first place as necessary 

Repeat Exercise One because of the mess caused by Exercise Two. 

Exercise Three: 
Obtain many large army tanks.  If none are available - purchase roofing tacks 
Place tanks or tacks (both are better) randomly thru the house 
At night, after everyone is in bed, keep the lights out and stroll through the house barefooted 
When you stump your toe or hit a tack, do not scream, it will wake up the child. 
Lesson Learned: No reason someone would ask for large equipment for their child if it was not medically necessary 

Exercise Four: 
Go to the drugstore 
Take out your wallet 
Tell the pharmacist to help himself to the wallet containing cash and credit cards 
Lesson Learned:  Why OTC was thought of in the first place as necessary 

Exercise Five: 
Purchase a laundromat 
Lesson Learned:  That using 53 washers a day is par for the course and that is why laundry services and stipends were thought of in the first place as necessary 

Exercise Six: 
Try to get a butterfly to make butter on a plane.  Burn a hundred dollar bill when they can't. 
Use a witch doctor to do your heart surgery.  Burn a hundred dollar bill when you decide you would rather not. 
Coach a lightning bug to bring on thunder and rain...Another hundred 
Tell someone catsup is really for having a kitten for dinner...Another hundred 
Rearrange your furniture and have carpet laid in a mushroom.....Burn another hundred 
Lesson Learned: A Rehabilitation Engineer is not an engineer for structures and is burning money 

Exercise Seven: 
Purchase a small vehicle, a volkswagon is good 
Fill it with gas 
Loosen the gas cap so it leaks a little 
Attach the car to the front of your clothing and carry it arround forever 
Lesson Learned:  A mechanical lift to avoid constant lifting is  a good idea and that is why it was thought of in the first place 

Exercise  Eight: 
Purchase a burlap bag and 125 pounds of sand 
Insert sand into bag and wet thoroughly.  Leave the end of the bag open.  Set your alarm clock 
Turn the bag, at night, every 45 minutes to the other side of the bed.  Make sure none of the sand leaks out.  If so, and it will,repeat the above steps 
Lesson Learned:  See Lessons One, Two, Three, Five and Seven 

Exercise Nine: 
Purchase stress incontinent pads by the gross 
Check out the price of a good iliostomy 
Buy Preperation H by the cases and ask for it for Christmas 
Lesson Learned:  See Lesson Seven 

Exercise Ten: 
Destroy your address book and any links with friends 
Cancel all magazine subscriptions 
Send out letters not to invite you to anything in the future 
Start thinking of what you will tell everyone when your spouse runs to Mexico screaming "I'm outta here" 
Inform your elderly parents that you are not recalling bad childhood traumas but, that you will  not  be traveling to see them at  Holidays anymore 
Lesson Learned:  Respite is a good idea and that is why it was thought of in the first place 

Exercise Eleven: 
Purchase the biggest, most expensive, ugliest gas hog of a van that you can find 
Quit your  job because of a lack of a sitter for the child 
Hock everything of value 
Spend savings and college funds for children 
Lesson Learned:  Having to have a new van in order to get a lift is unrealistic 

Exercise Twelve: 
Place Governor Bush into an Intermediate Care Facility for The Developmentally Disabled 
Treat him as you would any other client 
Start immediatley working on getting him out of there 
Lesson Learned:  The true definition of "reasonable promptness" 

Exercise Thirteen: 
Turn down your brother-in-law mechanic that will take care of your car for $100.00.   
Take your car instead to a stranger that mucks the work and causes you to pay $3,000.00 
Turn down your teen age son that will cut the grass, the way you like it, for the cost of the gas only, $2.75. 
Hire a stranger to do it for $50.00 and then resod when it kills the grass.l 
Keep your home clean for the cost of supplies only or hire a maid that steals from you and costs you $300.00 (and the supplies) a week 
Lesson Learned:  It is cheaper to have the work done at home by the family and that is why HCBS was thought of in the first place 

Exercise Fourteen: 
Put a good attorney on speed dial 
Remove the words Federal Funds from all your literature 
Get your good suit cleaned for the Press 
Lesson Learned:  When lessons are not learned there are prices to pay 

Ho, Ho, Ho - 
Merry Christmas!

Realizing you must be inundated with e-mail, I wanted to make sure you 
received the following, since I had not heard back from you... 


Gov. Bush: 

I wanted to make you aware of an opportunity as well as followup on a brief 
discussion we had back in late September, prior to the Florida Tourism 
Commission meeting at Amelia Island. 

First the opportunity. 

More than 500 volunteers, in the Florida Keys, recently completed the bulk of 
construction on a new two-acre playground in Marathon. Most of the park and 
its play accessories were concepted by elementary school kids, with final 
design and engineering plans completed and supervised by a professional 
playground design firm. The new facility is to be dedicated before Christmas 
and given the nature of this project, I thought you might wish to preside 
over the ceremony. The date is somewhat flexible, so perhaps it can be 
considered by you and your schedulers. The park's location is quite close to 
Florida Keys Marathon Airport, making transportation  simple. Perhaps you or 
a staff member might let me know if this can be considered. 

Next, the followup. 

Prior to the Florida Tourism Commission meeting, we chatted about the need 
for a Florida Keys tourism representative to serve on the Florida Tourism 
Commission. The Keys has no representation on the board and given the role 
that Monroe County plays in Florida tourism, I am asking for your assistance 
to help make this happen. Ideally we feel that Harold Wheeler, director of 
the Monroe County Tourist Development Council would make an ideal candidate.

Subject:	Teacher Education

Dear Jeb, 

I thought this abstract and its associated article were very interesting, so 
much so that I believe it to be worth your attention.  The more I travel 
from school to school throughout the state, the more I understand that real 
reform will only come with better teaching - and better teaching will only 
come with better teachers.  Sadly, this profession is presently being 
populated from the bottom up - and this must change!  In addition, I have 
begun teaching one course per semester at UCF in their College of Education. 
This has added to my dismay, as I have been able to see first hand the 
implausibility of what Colleges of Education portend to accomplish. I 
believe this article suggests an interesting alternative out of which there 
can be a myriad of solutions for raising the level of teacher talent and 
competency. 

As always, your friend, 
Alex:) 

P.S.  Hope you are doing well amongst the legislative choas.  I look forward 
to more peaceful, quiet times.  Don't you? 


"TEAR DOWN THIS WALL: RADICALLY OVERHAULING TEACHER CERTIFICATION 
Contrary to the claims of some critics, the problem of teacher 
certification is not the existence of schools of education and teacher 
preparation programs or their particular failings. The real problem lies 
in state laws that give these schools and programs a monopoly on training 
and certifying teachers. The arguments fall into two camps. Some propose 
abolishing schools of education or doing away with certification 
altogether. Others believe that adding new barriers to entry or creating 
advanced "master teacher" certifications will address the quality problem 
and increase the "rigor" of teacher preparation programs. According to 
Frederick Hess, neither of these approaches will adequately tackle the 
problems at hand. This paper proposes a third way: a "competitive 
certification" model that breaks the monopoly education schools hold on 
the supply of teachers with the aim of expanding the pool of potential 
teachers while also addressing the issue of quality. The goal is to 
increase the pool of qualified applicants for teaching jobs and at the 
same time increase the competition among providers of preparation and 
ongoing professional development for teachers."
